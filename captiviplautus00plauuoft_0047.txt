Terence, as may be seen from Donatus, soenes of a purely
lyric character were marked aLML'. (perhaps an abbrevia-

musical accompaniinent, simply C. (though this rests upon
the opinion of Ritschl, Donatus giving us no information
on this point); those consisting of ordinary dialogue, DV}

of the play (before the prologue) and between the acts.
The music for the plays of Plautus and Terence seems to
have been composed entirely by slaves. The music was
given by a single flute-player (tibicen), probably by the
composer himself, with a double flute, or, perhaps we might
say, clarinet, as the instrument bore a greater resemblance
to it than to our flute. It was played by blowing into both
tubes at the same time. From the didascaliae we 103111 of
four different kinds of these instruments: tibiae pares, in
which the two pipes were of equal length; tibiae impares,
in which they were of unequal length, tibiae serv-(mae, of
which but little is known, though they were probably of
equal length32 and άιιαε deoetrcce tibiae, in which the two
tubes were of equal length and identical in key and note.
Regarding the last-mentioned tibiae, we are told by Varro
that the right tube was for leading (tibia iacentium), the
left for accompanying (tibia szcccentiucc). We have 110 fur-

kinds of these instruments3 but we may be certain that the
choice of instrument depended upon the character of the
