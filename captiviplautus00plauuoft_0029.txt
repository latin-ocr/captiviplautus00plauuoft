all quarters, of the scattcrod and neglectod plays of Ronw‘s
greatest comediam, Plautus. At any rato, sonu· surh ‹fol-
lection must have been made by some one at about this
time. There is, however, no reason to suppose that it
consisted only of the twenty-one plays now assigned to
Plautus. It is probable that other plays were extant and
were included in the collection, and that another grain-
marian published a critical edition of twenty—one of these
plays, including in this corpas only such as Varro had said
(see p. xv) were admitted by everybody to be undoubtedly

polations crept in, and the text became still further corrupted.
It should be noticed, however, that the corruptions dating
from this period are chiefly due to a lively interest in the
plays, while the earlier corruptions above referred to (p. xxii)
were due to carelessness and neglect.

play of erudition, and a popular field for such display was
that offered by archaic Latin. Great zeal was shown in the
study of the early poets. The principa] representative of
the learning of this period is C. Sulpicius Apollinaris. It
is possible that the non-acrostic arguments (see p. xxi) were
written by this critic. Plautus was, however, doomed to
be forgotten again. In the Middle Ages he seems to have
been practically unknown. Hrotswitha von Gandersheim,
an imitator of Terence, who flourished in the latter half of
the tenth century, knows nothing of him. At thc bcginning
of the fifteenth century all but eight of the plays uere still
