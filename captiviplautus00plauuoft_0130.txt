66 NOTES. [PAon 3

Alide: Alis is Doric for E'lis. As Doric was the dialect of the Greeks in
southern Italy, it is not strange that Doric forms were adopted into Latin.

10. patri huiusce: the h apparently prevents elision here, as often.
See Introd. ὅ 74, and App. iam hoc tenetis: have you cauyht the
idea P literally, have you already hold os this ? (of. the English slang,
“catch on *Ρ '⁷). The prologue takes an affirmative answer, on the part
of the spectators, for granted, and expresses his satisfaction with their
attention and interest by saying optumumst. At this point, however,
for the purpose of stirring up his audience, he pretends to see some one
at a distance from the stage waggishly shaking his head, or giving some
other indication of dissent. What is said in lines 11-16 must not be
taken too seriously ; the prologue is too good-natured, and too desirous
of putting his hearers in good humor, to lose his temper easily. optu-
mumst: very well, For the loss of initial e in est, see note on captust
in verse 1 of the Argumentum. But see App. The forms optimus,
mamimus, etc., began to replace the early forms optumus, maxumus,
etc.‚ toward the end of the Republic.

11. This verse can be read metrically only by admitting hiatus
between hercle and ille, and again between ille and ultumas, and by
treating the final syllable of ultumas as long. The first hiatus might
be obviated by treating the final syllable of neyat as long. The verse
is probably corrupt. hercle: consound him! ultumus: some
one in the edge of the crowd. For the form, see note on optumum in
10. accedito: the future imperative is commonly used only when
a distinct interval is supposed to elapse before the command is to take
effect or to be obeyed3 hence its use in laws, maxims, recipes, etc.
Sometimes (and apparently in the present passage) it is used in a
command that is intended to be obeyed as soon as uttered. Abscedito
would seem to make better sense, and is actually adopted by some
editors.

12. si non ubi, etc.: as no one makes a move in obedience to his
accedito, the prologue changes his tone somewhat3 if the fellow can-
not find a seat and. behave himself, he may “take a walk'’ (outside,
of course). ubi sedeas, ubi ambules: to sit, to leiterally,
where you may sit, where you may walle—volitive characterizing clauses,
The following sorts of characterizing clauses should be noted: —

1. Predicating a hypothetical case: is est qui mentiatur, he is α
‘man who would cheat. In a clause of this type, the subjunctive
has the same force as in an independent paratactical clause 3 e. g. is
mentiatur, he would cheat.
