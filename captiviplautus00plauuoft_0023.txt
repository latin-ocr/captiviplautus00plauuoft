HISTORY OF GREEK AND ROMAN COMEDY. xvii

only, as yet, to that of Plautus. He died soon after
Ennius, with whom in life he had been on the most inti-
mate terius.

Π..- Publius Terentius Afer was born at ('a1·thage‚ about
190 13.c.¹ At an early age, hc came to Rome as a slave of
the, senator Terentius Lucanus. His master, struck by the
talent and the prepossessing appearance of the boy, not
only caused him to be cai-efully educated, but also gave him
his freedom. The associations to which he had been accus-
tomed in the house of his master made it easy for him to
keep up his connections with the nobility of Rome, and cer-
tain prominent members of this nobility became his firm
friends. chief among these were Scipio Africanus (the
younger), C. Laelius, and L. Furius Philus.

12. The literary tendency of the times, as well as his
own inclination, led the poet to devote his activity to
the sabula palliata. Terence produced his first comcdy,
the Andria, at the Indi Meqalenses, in April, 166 Bc The
aediles, who had charge of the games, had some misgivings
about allowing the presentation of a play by an entirely
unknown poet. He was accordingly induced to submit his
play first to the older poet Caecilius, for approval. Regard-
ing the meeting between these two poets, the following
story is told. Terence found Caecilius at dinner, and, as
the caller was meanly dressed, he was given a seat on a
bench near the conch on which the great author was reclin-
ing, and was then given permission to read what he had
written. After the first few verses had been read, Caecilius
was so captivated by the young man's talents that he in-
vited him to a place beside him upon the couch. He then
listened attentively and with unbounded admiration to the
remainder of the play.

¹ The date generally given is 185. iu accordance with Suetonius, in
his vita Terenti ‚· but II. Sauppe (Nachr. (Ζ. Gb‘ec. (ses, 1870, pp. 111 ff.)
has made this date seem very improbable.
