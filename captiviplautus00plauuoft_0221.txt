PAGt m] Aer v. sento: 4. 157

1021. ξε (ess): for ὗε, as regularly in Plautus and Terence.
gnate mi: sec note on prtem· vm· in 0:3⁴3. Sec App. ·

1022-1023: such repetitions, ou the part of one who is trying to
recall something almost forgotten, are common phoenomena. Sec App.

1024. per nebulam: would be more appropriate with in menm-
riam reqrcdior, but it is apparently felt as going with audisse,- cs.
Pseud. 463, quae quasi per nebulam seimus acque audiuimus. The II
of Heqio makes the preceding syllable long. uocarier : when used
of personal experience, πιωηιίιί (ιο which ιή mamm-iam rem-edisti· is
here equivalent) commonly takes the present infinitive instead of the
perfect. G.-L. 281. 2 ; Η. 618. 2.

1025. sit leuior: be relieved ‚· literally, be lz'ther.

1026. principio : strengthening the idea of prae in praeuortier.

1027. faber: blacksmieh.

1028. quoi . . . feceris: as much as to say, you may well speak
of “giving '⁹ to one who is penniless ; another attempt at a grim j0ke‚
in allusion to Hegio's proposal to “give '⁹ (“ dem '') him something.
Feccris is future perfect indicative.

After the close of the play proper, it was customary for one member
of the company to come forward, and, in the name of the company,
ask the audience for plaudits ot· approval. In Terence, the speaker
does this very briefly, with the wordS, ualete ec plaudite, or simply
plaudite ,· but in Plautus, his address is commonly, as in the present
play, somewhat elaborate. It is possible that lines 1029-1036 were pro-
nounced by the entire company in concert, instead of by a single actor.

1029. ad : with due reqarcl ιο.

1031. pueri suppositio: as in the Truculentus, in which play
Phronesium palms off upon Stratophanes a child, under the pretext
that it is hers and that he is the father of it ; cf. also a similar case in
the Andria of Terence.

1032. neque ubi: nor (cases) where. clam: often a preposi-
tion in early Latin, but in Terence only with mc and te. In classical
times it was used only as an adverb.

1033. reperiunt: i.e. in the Greek plays which serve them as
their models.

1034. ubi, ete: whercby (Le. throuqh che influence os which), a
colloquial use.

1035. neque odio fuimus: and have noi bared you ,· literally, und
have noc been sor annoyancc (to you).
