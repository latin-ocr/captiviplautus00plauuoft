xxviii INTRODUCTION.

The poets had business relations, for the most part, only with
these managers, who bought, or rejected, their plays, and
who accordingly were very influentia] in determining the
fate, and encouraging the development, of poetic talent. In
exceptional cases, however, the givers of the games, as they
were men of experience in such matters and naturally felt
great interest in the success of the persor-mances, had a
voice in the selection of the plays to be presented. All
financial risk attending the presentation of a play was borne
by the theatrica] manager. As it was of great importance
to the givers of the games that the people should be pleased
with the amusements provided for them at such great ex-
pense, a reward was offered to the (lominus, varying in
amount according to the success of the play given by him.¹
This of course was calculated to secure the choice of the
best possible play and to assure its presentation in the best
possible manner. The (lominus on his part was accustomed,
after a successful performance, to reward the deserving
actors of his company with a banquet. Cf. Plaut. Uist. 7853
Rud. 1418 ff.

28. As regards the externa] equipment necessary for the

dramatic performances, this was provided by contractors .

(conductores,· cf. Plaut. Asin. Prol. 3), under the super-
vision of those who gave the games.²

29. Among the Greeks, the number of actors allowed
upon the stage at any one time was limited. This was not
the case among the Romans, as there could be any number
of actors which convenience might dictate. The dominus

yreqis did not, of course, care to increase the Γᾞῑῐὼθι· un-
1 The assertion of Mommsen, Rom. G'esch. 1.ss p. 889, that the poets
received their reward only when the play did not prove a failure, has
not been substantiated.
2 The eostuuies of the actors were provided by the choraqzcs, whom
Mommsen (Rom. Gesclz. Ι. p. 886) regards as identical with the domi-
nus qreyzs.
