148 NOTES. [Pion 50

882. iam diu: now lonq since, to be taken with the preceding
surripuit. The idea is so improbable that Hegio thinks there must be
some inistake about it. Βία commonly means sor α lons] time, but
frequently in early Latin, and occasionally later, it is used as in the
present passage, in the sense of lons] αςμ). See App.

pense of the towns mentioned, which were at the tinic very unpopular

towns.

885. autumabas: viZ. in 188 ; cf. 497. uae aetati tuae: woe
be unco you l literally, moe. to your ltfe. Vae herc forins an exception
to the rule that monosyllabic interjections are not elided.

886. quippe quando: (you may well say ‘⁶ ecoe be unco y0u'’)
since, indeed, etc. Quippe is frequently thus used with causal par-
ticles and causal relative clauses, for greater emphasis. mihi nil
credis, quod, etc.: you (Jranc me no confidence ῖη what I say z'n all
cccrnestness ,· nil is the accusative of the ⁸⁵ inner object '' (⁶‘result pro-
duced”); that with reference to which no confidence is felt is the
antecedent to be supplied for quod. Such an antecedent might be in
the genitive case, as seen from passages like the following z Asin. 459,
quoi omnium rerum ipsus semper credin Truc. 307, numquam mihi
quisquam posthac (lucarum rerum creditit.

887. Stalagmus : the person is thrust upon the attention first, the

as well as after postquam ‚⁹ see 282 ; Am. 668 3 Stich. 511 3 Epid. 217 ;

888. boiam terit: lze's α captive ‚· litera11y‚ he wears α boia, i.e. a
wooden or iron collar put about the neck of prisoners 3 butssoz'a means
also a Boian woman (the Boii were a people just south of the Po), and
Boiam terit, therefore, means also he has α Βοίαη wife, or a Boian
‘tvoman has taken him captive ,· it is with reference to this double
meaning of the phrase that Ergasilus playfully says, Boius esc, he’s a
Boion now.

889. liberorum quaerundorum: alluding to his propensity for
acquiring children, shown in his having stolen Hegio's little boy.
