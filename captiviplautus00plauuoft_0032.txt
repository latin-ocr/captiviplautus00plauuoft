from their own private means. Resides the games that were
thus celebrated on behalf of the state, there were also others
given on extraordinary occasions, viz. ludi funebres (orfime-
mles), in honor os celebrated men, those accompanying dedi·
cations and triumphs, and those given as votive offerings.
24. Down to 174 nc. the dramatic performances took
place near tho temple of the deity chiefly concerned in the
festivities.¹ l'ermanent theatres of stone, such as were later
built on a scale of great grandeur, were as yet unknown.
W hen a play was to be produced, a wooden stage was erected
for the purpose, and then taken down after the performance.
This stage was ordinarily built near the foot of some hill,
or slope, so that the rising ground might afford convenient
scats sor the spectators, while those in front would not
obstruet the view of those in the rear. On such a slope the
people assembled under the open sky. As no scats were
provided for their acconunodation, they usually sat, or
reclined, upon the ground. The more fastidious sometimes
had stools brought for them from their homes, although
this was looked upon as a mark of effeminacy and was
even forbidden. In 179 Bc, a stage of stone was erected
near the temple of Apollo, but this was of small dimensions
and was probably intended for use only at the ludi Apolli-
nares, Five years later, arrangements were made, on the
part of the state, for the building of a substantial, per-
manent stage,2 but this, if it was actually built, seems
soon to have disappeared. In 146 B.c., L. Mummius built
a complete theatre, provided with rows of seats, but this
was of wood, and was taken down after each erformance.
Finally, in 55 13.c., was dedicated the stone theatre of Cn.
Pompeius, the first permanent theatre erected in Rome. It

forum. That the Iudi Apollinares at least, in the beginning, were
given in the Cirr-ns Maximus, is clear from Liv. 25. 12, 14.
