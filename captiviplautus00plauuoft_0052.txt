It is important to note, however, that 111 511011 cases the
long syllable may bc shortened only when the short syllable
innncdiately proceeding begins a word. The shortening,
furtherlnore, seems to take place only 111 the following
cases:—

(1) In a dissyllabic iambic word.¹

(2) In a monosyllabic word (or one that has become such
by elision) preceded by a short monosyllable (or a word.
which has become such by elision).

(3) In the first syllable of a word of two or more sylla-
bles 111-00011011 by a short nionosyllable (or a word that has

become such by elision);
(4) In the second syllable of a polysyllabic word begin-

ning with a short syllable.

In the cases under (3) and (4), the rule holds (possibly
with rare exceptions) only for syllables “lonq by position,''
but Ῐιαυὶης] α. short vowel.

Another effect of the metrica] accent 15 frequently seen
in cases where monosyllabis} words ending in a long vowel,
or 111 m, instead of being elided before a following vowel, or
h, receive the ictus and are treated as short syllables; see
