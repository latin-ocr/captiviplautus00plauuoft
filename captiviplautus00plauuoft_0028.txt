magistrates regarding the productions of plays brought out
under their supervision. Consideration for the convenience
of the reader led to the practice of indicating at the begin-
ning of eat-,h scene the characters who take part in that
scene, and of ‹lividing plays into acts (see p. xxx). But,
after a tinie, interest in the perforinanees of the early
drama began to flag, and in the Augustali period not merely
had such perforinances ceased to be popular, but so little
interest was felt in Plautus himself that his plays now
found but few readers, and the copies produced during this
period were carelessly and indifferently niade. Many of
the corruptions in the text undoubtedly date from this
period of indifferenee. It was during this period, also, that
the plays became separated froin one another, each going
its own way through the hands of copyists, and each meet-
ing with its own fate. This independent circulation of
individnal plays accounts in part for the marked differences
in the condition of the texts. Some plays passed through
the hands of very careless and ignorant copyists, and are
still full of the corruptions they then received3 others fell
into worthier hands, and have come down to us in a more
satisfactory foi-1113 but all alike were less carefully treated
than would have been the case if a livelier and a more
general interest had been felt in the author. This period
