(cf. incipe‘sse in the next lino) or from some ono elsv. One should
be careful not to us(¹ ⁴· can '’ in translating such questions.

531-532. maxumas . . . haereo: set on sumt (some) haye piem:
os norwense, (some) torn-titvlvm. nugas inepti(as): if tho text is
correct, the s must be ended, or else we must read impellis, Sec App.
Incipisse: the speaker thus addresscs himself in ans-wer to the
questions he has just put to himself. No promising plan of action,
however, suggests itself at the moment, and in his despair he ejacu-
lates haereo, l'm stuck! But at the critical moment, as will be seen
below, a happy inspiration comes to him, and he rises to the occasion
(547 Π.) The initial Ιι of haereo prevents elision.

ACT 111. SCENE 4.

533. quo . . . dicam: i.e. I wonder in what direction that fellow
has hustled himself ont of the house now ! literally, in what ‹lireclion
shall I say chat thal sellnw has, etc.; but the use of a word of saying
under such circumstances is foreign to the English idiom. Cf. 268,
541, etc. nunc: the position of this word makes it probable that
it is to be taken with proripuisse ,· the use of nunc seems to indicate
that Hegio has had previous experiences with runaways and was sus-
picions (cf. 456 f.).

534. enim uero (also written em'muer0): ιή very crath. Enim
alone commonly means indeed, in Plautus and Terence, and occa-
sionally even in Cicero and Caesar. eunt ad te : are aster you.

535. quid loquar: what am I quinq to say? The following
fabulabor and neqabo make it probable that loquar also is here a
future indicative, but the present subjunctive is much more common ;
cf. 531, quid machiner? In early Latin the indicative (but commonly
the present indicative) is very common in deliberative questions; see
note on 208.

536. omnis in incerto : omnis sometimes seems to have the value
of only two morae and to have been pronounced b-mnis. quid . . .
confidam? what confidence shall Ι put ? See App.

537. utinam . . . perderent: one might expect perdidissent of
an unfulfilled wish referring to the past. prius . . . quam
periisti : as perire frequently serves as the passive of perflet-e, there
seems to be here a play upon words: O chal tlte (mas had [alcen you
away before you were ‘⁶ taken away '⁹ from yomfitlhmlaml.

538. qui . . . facie: the indicative is about as frequent as the
subjunctive in causa! qai-clauses ; the indicative calls attention merely
