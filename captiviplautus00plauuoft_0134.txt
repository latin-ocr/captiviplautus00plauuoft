nil . . . parsit . . . dum parceret: hezo-as notsavz'ngy of Ιιῑε money,
if 011st hc miylzt save his son (Sonuenscliein), i.e. he spent money
freely in the hope of rccovering his son; Β. 310. Ι. parsit:
regularly in Plautus, and often 111 Terence, for popercz't.

33. reconciliare: originally meant to brius] tossether <mamm then
it came to be used, as in the present passage, of only one of the
parties to be brought together, 111 1116 561156 of to brings back. This
latter meaning, however, is confined to early Latin.

34. emit: the length of the final syllable may be due to the
following h, but not necessarily, as the vowel was originally long and
this quantity is occasionally retained ; see Introd. ἓ 74. de quaes—
toribus: although ιΐαῖγηῖαε) palliatae are, generally speaking, dis-
tinctly Greek in coloring, allusions to Roman life are frequent in
Plautus, and are found occasionally in Terence. Here (though it
must be remembered that the prologus may not have been written
by Plautus) there 15 a distinct allusion to the Roman quaestores, the
officers who had charge of the financial affairs of Rome and accord-
ingly of the disposition of the booty and the prisoners taken in war.

Hisce shows this early —s, the -ce being merely the strengthening
demonstrative particle seen in liic (for hice), illic, etc. Cf. illisce
in Most. 499. hunc . . . dolum: i.e. the one already made clear
to the audience by the appearance of the captives and what has been
said of them.

36. quo pacto . . . amittat: a purpose clause (not an indirect
question). amittat : very frequent in early Latin in its etymolog-
ical sense, to send (tit-ay (α, mitto). This original meaning weakened
to let yet aum] (unintentionally), i.e. to lose, its regular meaning in
classical Latin and one not unusual even in Plautus, eg. lines 23,
143. etc.

38. illic: for illc, see Introd. ξ 87 (b). For thwompare the
c 111 liic and see note on hisce, 35.

39. huius: hu‘ffcs ; 566 Introd. ξ 79. illic : this is probably to
be pronounced here as a monosyllable illc ,· see Introd. ξ 83, and App.
illius: ίῑῑῖἷιε. fert imaginem ι is (lisquised as,· literally, bears the
likeneSS.

40. hic ι regularly short in early Latin. 'expediet : will set on ⁵
- foot, work ont; ewedh-e litei-ally meaning to yet the feet out (ex, pes).
