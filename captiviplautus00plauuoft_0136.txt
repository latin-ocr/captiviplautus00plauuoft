viz. α drama ,· sometimes mere calls, fiction. Herc two meanings are
in mind : (1) (ι drama with reference to assetur nnhz's; (2) aficm'on in
contrast with res (reality).

53. uos quod monitos uoluerim : which I have wanted you advised
of. Thc subjunctive noluerim is due to the fact that it stands in a clause
of characteristic. It is not a subjunctive of “contingent futurity‚''
meaning I should lz'lce. See App. uos quod: A. ἃ, G. 2:38. l›; B.
178. 1. ‹Z; G.-L. 333. 1; II. 412. monitos: monere starts with
the idea to brius) to clm monz,- according to the character of what
is thus brought to the mind, the verb may be translated by inform,
αιῖυῐκθ, warh. For a transition from the idea of “advise '⁹ to that of
“infor1n,'' cf. “advise of⁷' (in the sense of ιι111Ῐ()1’111”), where the
idea of giving advice is no longer present.

54. operam dare: see note on 6.

55. pertractate: in the ordinary hackneyed mamzer, pertractus
meaning literally much (clem-ouyhly) hamllcd. Pertractate is elsewhere
used only in a good sense, elaboratam, etc. See App.

56. uorsus : frequent in early Latin for uersus ‚· cf. voster for uester,
uorteae for uertex, etc. immemorabile-s: not to be repeated. Adjec-
tives in -bz'lis connnonly denote capacity or ability in a passive sense,
but “ can not be '³ easily merges into ‘⁶ ought not to be,'' and this latter
idea is the predominant one here in immevwrabilcs. Cf. our phrase
“not to be avoided‚'' which may mean: (1) “cannot be avoided’';
(2) “ ought not to be avoided.'⁷

57-58. leno, meretrix, miles gloriosus: stock characters in the
plays of Plautus.

58. ne uereamini: Sonnenschein compares the words of Bottom
(Me'dsmmner Nztyhc's Dream, Act ΙΙΙ. Scene 1) :—

“Fair ladies, I would entreat you not to fear . . . if you think I come
hither as a lion, it were pity of my 1i1e‚” etc.

60. scria illic : for the shortening of the -ῑε, see Introd. ξ 84.

61. paene iniquomst : (that we should all os α sudden attempt to
acc α trayesly, etc.) is hardly a sair chiny to ask (and ther fore of course
you will not expect it). Cf. lonqum esc, it's α long] story (and so I will

“ it would be hardly fair‚'' “ it would be a long story,'’ but one must
not suppose that the Romans felt z'm'quomsc and longlum est as equiva—
lent to iniquom sic and {missum sit. The indicative est in such phrases
