104 NOTES. [Plan 20

340. aestumatum : with α price set upon h 1‘m; literally, ap-
prats‹›‹z,· the aniount thus fixed was to bc forfeited to Hegio in case
the supposed slave failed to return. See App. des z the rule com-
monly given, that the present subjunctive in connnands is used chiefly
of an indefinite person, is not true for any period of Latin. In
Plautus and Terence there are only twelve instances of this use ad-
dressed to an indefinite person. while there are 128 instances addressed
to a definite person. In Cicero there are only four instances (not
counting those used as protases, eg. rosses, respondeam) addressed to
an indefinite person, while there are twenty-two (all in the Epistulae)
addressed to a definite person. See App.

341. illi: adverb. immo: see note on 209. misero z on this
rhetorical, energetic use of the future perfect at the end of a line, see
note on iuero in 194, with the App. on 'that passage.

342. tuom: this word and tua in the next line are emphasized by
their positions ; cf. also the emphatic zu that follows. This emphasis
is apparently explained by the fact that Hegio is contrasting his son,
Philopolemus, and his (i.e. Philopolemus') father with Philocrates
and his (Philocrates') father. By the proposed plan, communication
would be established in both directions.

343. uelis: the subjunctive is (lue to its dependence upon another
subjunctive.

344. nil est: it's no use, i.e. it is labor lost. luseris: will
have friccerecl away, a true future perfect, referring to what will have
resulted when the opera is finished; it is thus a different use of the
tense from that found in 194, 293, 341, etc.

345. omne: the whole things. See App. transactum reddet:
differs from transz'yet in calling attention to the state resulting from
the act; trcmsiyec would refer merely to the act itself. Cf. the Eng-
lish phrase, “get a thing finished‚'’ instead of “ finish a thing.''

346. quoi plus credat: in whom he has more confidence‚ a predi-
cating characterizing clause of the developed type (⁵⁶ clause of charac-
teristic'') ; see note on 12. Plus is the accusative of “the inner
object‚’' 01· of “ the result produced.'’ A. ἃ G. 238. bfssle'ffi ; G.-L.
332, 3333 H. 409.

347. magis . . . ex sententia: more ιο his mind.

348. neque adeo : nor yet, and furthermore not. Adeo (ad -1- eo)
follows rather closely the meaning of its constituent parts : —-

(1) to that (such α) point (os space, time, or deyree); to α hiyh
deyree, very (see note on mirum adeo in 824);
