plistu. nima quam cupio : seems to be a. fusion of two 011111033111113,

iuuentutis: from the young] men. sese (emphatic 101 se): no
one but themselves. omnis: in early Latin the nominative plural
of i-stems often ends, as the accusative regularly does, 111 -ἶε, Later,
-es is the only form of the nominative ; even in the accusative, the -es
of consonant stems gradually encroaches upon the original -is, and by
the close of the Augustan period 11113 driven it out almost entirely,
the principal exception after that time being omnis.

105. i11(e) demum: but θείη-(93 (ι ymmss man ‘et-Im ‚· litei-ally, 110 αι
lenam, etc. Domum is often best translated by laying emphasis upon
the word 11 immediately follows, which 13 commonly a pronoun or 1111

same wei-thy character as he, literally‚ very (vom) wei-thim character-
ized by his (1.0. the young man's) character ‚· eius 13 probably felt as
modifying both pater and moribus‚· when 11 word is thus used to

words.
