in adapting the productions of foreign genius to Roman ears,

titles (Assum-sa„ Aululcmviz„ Captivi, ete), except in plays
like the Amphitruo and the Epidicus, where the title is taken
from the Greek name of a person in the play. Attention
has already been called to the fact that the plays of Plautus
abound in Roman allusions. Later, however, as the influ-

was an ever-increasing tendency to make the Latin plays
more nearly like the Greek from which the plots were taken.
Indeed, the contemporaries of Terence, among them his chief
adversary, Luscius Lanuvinus, made it a point of attack that
he sometimes departed so far from his Greek original as to
weave into the general plot of his drama such scenes from ’
other Greek comedies as particularly struck his fancy. This
process of combining parts of different plays into one was
maliciously called contaminatio. Except in thispcffie respect,
