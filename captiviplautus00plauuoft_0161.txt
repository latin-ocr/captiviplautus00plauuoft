(cf. “as amatter of Μεθ’). Such an expression following a statouwnt
implies that what has been already alleged is not true, hut that what fol-
lows is. This relation between what follows and what lias precede-«l is
thus one of opposition, and uerum at length canu· to lie felt men-ly as

sruz (cf. Pseud. 468, tamen ero ον’νιιῃι· lionae), sur use ‚· but as sur use
practieally meant usesul, this dat-ive came to be regarded, ancl used,
as an indeclinable adjective, meaning proper, honest, discr-eet, etc.

admutilabit probe: will sset riqht down ιο che stt-in in fine style,-
with this use of probe, cf. the English expression “ a qood thrashing. ”

270. quid tu: quid and quid tu are frequently used merely to
secure the close attention of the person addressed to a question about
to be asked, performing the same function as the English ‘⁶ how is it ‘2‘ '⁴
‘⁴ say ! '’ ‘⁴ by the way !'' or the like. With tu, probably no particular
verb was felt to be omitted; it merely stands in a general way as the
subject of action. mauelis : represents exactly the same use of the
subjunctive as in uelim (I should like).

271. quod sit: which would be. If the quod-clause were used in
the sense of which is, the indicative would here be used, as it would
then be either a determinative clause (the particular one os these
alternative-<1 which, ete), or one equivalent to si with tlie indicative
(whatever is, i.e. is anythz'nq is, etc, that is what I want). In the
latter case the characterizing idea, no matter how prominent, would
not give rise to the subjunctive. See Appenclz'x ιο Benneu‘s Latin
Grammar, 5 402, with the references there given. longissume:
one would expect lonyz'ssumum ,· the adverb gives the degree to which
the idea of sit α malo is true, the adjective would ascribe to the ante-
cedent. of quod a characteristic (a malo lonqz'ssumum).

273. erat: Philocrates used the perfect fnit in the preceding
verse; the imperfect here shows that his mind is wandering back
and dwelling‚ as it were, amid the former scenes. quam si essem:
one might expect fuissem, but quam εἰ here follows the same con-
struction as when it means as ²'s (cf. note on quasi in 181), the im-
perfect here representing the present tense thrown back into the past.
In early Latin, however, the present subjunctive is apparently fre-
quently used in unreal present conditions and the imperfect in nnreal
