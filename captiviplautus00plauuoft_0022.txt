been genuine productions of Plautus, but most of them
were undoubtedly the works of some inferior poet or poets.
While all of the twenty plays preserved to ns are fabulae
palliatae, l'lantus treated his Greek originals with consid-
erable l'rcedom, and never liesitated to introduce distinctly
Roman allusions, and to recast in a monld of his own the
material offered him by his original, wherever he thought
that by such rccasting he could add to the humor or interest
of the play. 1*Ί or the points of contrast between Plautus
and Terence in this and other respects, see p. xix ff. As
already indicated, the popularity of Plautus among his con-
temporaries was unrivalled. On the Subsequent history
of his plays, and the judgment of posterity regarding them,

9. Q. Ennius is chiefly noted for his epic poem called
Annales,—i11 which he related, in eighteen books, the entire
history of Rome from the earliest times down to his own,—
for his saturae, and his tragedies. But he also attempted
comedy, and so deserves mention here. He was born at
Rudiae in Calabria, in 2⁰9 lac. In ‘204 he was brought
by the quaestor M. Porcius Cato from Sardinia to Rome,
where he seems to have lived in moderate circumstances as
toacher of Greek and as stage poet. In 184 nc. he received
the right of Roman citizenship, which he lived to enjoy for
fifteen years. None of his comedies have come down to us
—not even in fragments of any importance.

10. The next poet worthy of mention in this connection
is Stafius Caecilius, who enjoyed an enviable reputation
among the ancients as a writer of palliatae, and who was an
important forerunner of Terence. An Insubriffiby birth,
lie came to Rome about 194 Bc, probably as a captive
taken in war. Later, however, he was given his freedom.
His first attempt at comedy failed, and was not even heard
to the end by the impatient audience3 but he toiled on till
he won literary fame and a name among comio poets second
