134 NOTES. [Pion 40

frustra esc, palam est, 010. dedisse operam malam : have done a

bad turn.

703. uotuin: archaic for uecuz' (cf. uerte, uester, etc., for nerto,
uester, 010). The answer “ yes ⁷’ is of course expected, but -ne itself
contains 110 suggestion of this answer ; the effect is much the sainc as
in (ῖίιῖ I, or ‹lidn'c I, forbid yon Δ) cf. 713, ωηῖαενεεηε necne 9 and sce
note on 121. It was Philocrates, rather than Tyndarus, whom Hegio
had warned (264) that he must tell the truth.

705. uera obessent: the pluperfect tense might have been ex-
pected, but the evil that would have resulted from telling the truth
would have continued into the present.

708. custodem: i.e. paedaqogsum, whose duty it was to look
after the children of the family. erus maior: i.e. the father of
Philocrates.

710. sorsum: i.e. seorsum.

711. siquis . . . faxit : the speaker starts 0111 as though he were
about 10 make his whole thought refer to future time, i.e. as if he were
about 10 say, think, in case any one should do 111ίὸ for your son, how
thankful you would feel ‚· the future imperative coyitato makes this
the natural course of thought, hence εἰ faxit (fecerit) instead of si
fecisset. With haberes, however, the character of the thought is
changed, and haberes is used as though sifecz'sset had preceded. Such
mixed conditions are common in colloquial language. This si faxit
(fecerit) is‘commonly explained as an instance of the perfect subjunc-
tive in an unreal past condition, correspouding to the early use of the
present subjunctive in unreal conditione, but no parallel instances of
such a use of 1110 perfect in proca-ses seem to be found.

713. emitteresne necne : this is interesting as showing the really
non-committal force of —ne in certain passages in early Latin where it
is said to be equivalent to nonne ,· see notes on 121 aud 703. For the
meaning of emittere manu, see note-on 408.

717. quid tu z see note on 270.

718. recens: an adverb. nuperum: no sure instance of this
adjective occurs elsewhere. Ὗ

719. te perdocere: for postulare with the infinitive and a sub-
ject accusative referring to the same person as the subject of the
principal verb, cf. Trin. 237 ; Cas. 141 ; etc.

720. quicum . . . exegeram: relative clauses in indirect dis-
course, unless they depend directly upon another subjunctive, com·
monly take, in early Latin, the same mood as in direct discourse ; see
note on qui est in 567. una : an adverb.
