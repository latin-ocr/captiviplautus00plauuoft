362-363. erus has more particular reference to a man’s relation
tovmrd his slaves; dominus to liis relation toward the family as a
whole, with all its belongings. Hegio secius to nse them licre, linw-
ever, without any particular distinction in mind. operam dare . . .
fideliter: to olwy ,thille-fully.

363. quod: in veham quod strictly lias its antecedent in the ellipsis
of some such idea as in that matter, or ιή those matters. uelit: uolt
in the preceding line has suggested an [mliv-ecc reporcae'ny of the speak-
er's own ideas; hence the subjunctive.

364. aestumatum huic: h here “makes position''; see note on
169.

365. uelle: i.e. se. uelle. ad patrem: notice the double mean-
ing: (1) your father, (2) his father; cf. 375, 379, etc.

366. meum: my own‚· note the position.

367. filiis: probably dative.

368. In what follows one should notice how cleverly, in word and

thought, Philocrates acts the part of a slave. utroque norsum:
in both directions, an adverbial expression sometimes written utroque-
uorsum. rectum: a paniciple, directed.

3⁰71. Hegio’s change of tone should be noted, as he begins to ad-
dress the supposed slave ; the emphatic tute tibi and tuopte, for instance,
are not deferential. tute: you're the one that. tuopte: this
emphasizing -pce is appended in Plautus to me, mea, meo, cuo, sua,
suom, suo.

3⁷2. Notice the hiatus. In early poetry‚ however, final m is
frequently not elided3 see Introd. ξ 85.

373. em tibi hominem: here’s your man! literally‚ behold the
man sor you. hominem: accusative after the verbal idea implied
in em. Em (en) must be distinguished from hem ,· the former means
lo! behold! look you! the latter. well, I declara J ahem! or the like.
See note on 183. gratiam habeo : here again the Ιι makes the pre-
ceding syllable long; see notes on 169, 364. Gratiam habere means
to feel yratqt'ul: literally‚ to have (fracicncle (in one's heare) ‚· ,qratias
affere, to express qraticttcle.

3⁰74. quom: probably an instance of the explicative quom, in chae,
or che saec tham see note on 151. facis: affmd.

376. qui me quid . . . agitem . . . perferat: me is grammatically
construed as the obJect of perferat, with quid ayz'cem as a sort of second-
ary object; literally‚ who will reporc me what I am doing] ,· logically we
should expect qnid . . . assitam alone. Such a use is common in Plautus
and Teren0e3 e.g. Heauc. 84, sac me ut sciam, for sac uc eqo sciam.
