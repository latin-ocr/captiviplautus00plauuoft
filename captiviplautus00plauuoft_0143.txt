him again. consimilis: similis takes the genitivi· ln carly Latin,
the dative (commonly) in post-Augustam Latin. 'l'hc interi-vnio:
period is one of transition, in which both the genitive and the dative
are frequent.

117. semel: emphatic position.

118. postilla: aster chat, formed like postea, and differing from it
in meaning, as ille differs from is. possis : you would never be nme,
i.e. no matter how much you should try ; “you can ‘' would be potos.

120. uidere: i.e. uideris. ita: equivalent to liber labentius
esse quam seruire, depending upon uidere, referring to the preceding
verbs in 118-119. non uidere ita tu quidem: the position of ειι
with its intensifying quidem indicates an impatient, spiteful tone.
Hegio says that the lorarius does not act as though lle cared about
being iree; if he did, he would try to be a better slave. Slaves were
sometimes manumitted from motives of kindness or gratitude 3 some-
times they purchased their freedom from what they had saved (pecu-
lium) out of their allowance.

121. quod dem: (onychino) for me to (sive, literally, (onychina)
which I may give, a volitive characterizing clause (see note on 12).
mene: -ne in early, as in Classical, Latin is non-committal. Some-
times the answer ‘⁶ yes '’ is expected, sometimes, as here and in 121,
the answer “ no,'' but in neither case is the answer suggested by the
form of the question, but rather by external circumstances. In such
cases the use of -ne, instead of nonne or num, produces a certain rhe-
torical effect, the implication being that the answer may safely be left
to be infer-red. Cf. “Do I, or do Ι not, look like an honest man {²⁷⁷
Sometimes necne is actually added, as in 713, emitteresne necne ? See
App. uis dem: the subjunctive in such cases probably originated
in a deliberative question ς uis Ρ clem 5> In the course of time dem came
to be looked upon as depending upon uis. The next step would be the
insertion of a word that would show this dependence, e. g. w‘s ¹nc (lem 9
but this use of ut always remained rare. The play of words in this
line should be noticed: zs I have nomino (else) co ye've (for myst-rse-
dom), do you want me co (sive you—thie slae'p mysvls ? With the
expression me dem in pedes, cf. me contuli in pedes (Bam-h. 374), se in
pedes conicere (Ter. Phorm. 190), in uiam se (lare (Cic. «alsam. XIV.
12), and the English expression “take to one's l1cels.''

122. erit extemplo: the emphatic position chosen sor eric hvightens
the eontrast with the non est of the preceding verse and intensilies thc
threatening tone: chere soon Q bc somethiny εΙιαι Q (sive ιο yon.
