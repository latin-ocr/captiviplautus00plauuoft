of the play itself.

73. An important difference between the practices of the
ancient and of the modern stage may be infel-red from Livy,

PROSODY.

The prosody and the language of Plautus differ far more
from those of the later classical authors, than do those of

eg. patrem (never patrem). Later, such syllables might be
pronounced long (ie. pat-rem) or short (i.e. partrem).
