gation that the ancient testimony, if any existS, cannot
possibly be ‹·‹›1·1·0et; (2) the conjecture must have been
sanctioned by tho consensus of all competent orities. Until
these requircinents are niet, all conjectures should be con-
linml to critical notes. It is better to leave a passage unin-
telligible, with the certain impr-int of the eenturies upon it,
than, at the risk of eontinuing the work of the corrupting
hands that have wrought before us, to introduce mere eon-
jectures that are not of such a nature as to command general
acceptant-e. While, therefore, I believe I have ‘duly consid-
ered all the important suggestions that have been made in
recent years so far as they bear upon the text of the Captivi,
and while Ι have mentioned many of these in my critical
notes, I have introduced but few of them into my text.
Such textual criticism as Ι 113νο allowed myself to indulge
in has been systematieally exeluded from the main 00111-
mentary and relegated to an Appendix, which is also util-
ized for the citation of authorities for statements made in
my notes, where such citation seemed desii-able.

In preparing the book Ι have had aeeess to all impor-
tant editions of the Captivi ,· but Ι have consulted most
frequently those of Brix-Niemeyer, Goetz and Schoell, Hal-
lidie, Leo, Limlsay, Morris, and Sonnensehein. To all of
these 1 hereby aeknowledge my indebtedness for valuable
help. Ι 3111 further indebted to Messrs. B. H. Sanborn δι
Co. for their courtesy in allowing me to embody 111 the
present volume 3 few pages from the Iutrodue-tiQ to my
edition of the Phormio, of which they are the publishers.

Ι must also express to Professor E. W. Fay, of the Uni-
versity of Texas, Professor Gouzalez Lodge, of Bryn Mawr
College‚ and Professor J. C. Rolfe, of the University of
Miehigan, my gratitude for their kiudness and generosity
