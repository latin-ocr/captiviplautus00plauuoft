92 NOTEs. Α [Pica 13

corum understood. E'a is apparently an early instance of the rare use
of thc ablative with compos ,· but the linc is corrupt. Sec App.

218. nunciam: probably composed of nunc· and iam; it is, how-
ever, trisyllabic, the ι’ becoming vocalic as in quoniam, etiam. Another
view regards nunciam, etiam, etc.‚ as made up of nunce, *eci (ef. ἔτι),
ctc., and an adverbial termination -ατη, si uidetur: 127⁸ you please ‚·
literally‚ {fit seems (qood to you).

219. arbitri, arbitrari: for the original meaning, here preserved,
of arbiter, see note on 210 ; arbitrari originally meant to be αη arbiter,
i.e. a witness; then as a witness of a thing would have an opinion
regarding the thing, it caule to mean to J'udgse, to think. The present
passage preserves one of the few instances of the original use of this
verb.

220. permanet: leals oum literally, crz‘chle throuyh. Notice the
emphatic position.

221. astu: ablative of astus. colas: manasse.

222. id: referring to the general idea, without reference to the
particular word (dol 17) already used.

225. tamen: i.e. even though the present prospects are good for
our successfully carrying out our scheme. uiso opust: there is need
of (our looking out, i.e.) sorcsissht,· literally, thare is need of it havz'ngy
been Zookecl out (hy us), where viso is of course to be understood as
impersonal and as used iu the sense os prouz'so. The neuter of the
perfect passive participle is often thus used in the comic poets with
opus est and usus esc. It may be translated as though it were a gerund,
though it differs from the gerund in substantivizing the conception of
the verb in a perfec-ted passive form, rather than in a progressing, ac-
tive form, Cf. the English expression, “There is no need of its being
known,’' where the use of ‘⁴ its ’⁷ shows that ‘⁴ being known '' is prac-
tically felt as a substantive, expressing a state resulting from an act of
becomz'ny known.

227. haud somniculose: cf. our expression, ‘⁶ wide-awake,” used
in similar connections.

229. nam : (and you may well hope) for. tu: i.e. I do not need
