Professor Edouard W'dlfflin, in the Archiv fiir Lateinisclze Lexikographie
und Grammatik. February, 1896. Auf geringem Raume ist viel wis-
senswt'irdiges zusammengedrangt, und zwar mit praktischem Geschicke;
zwei langere Listen geben die lateinischen Worter von bestrittener Quan-
tit‘a‘t und Orthographie, wobei die Ansatze von Marx oft berichtigt sind.
. . . Die deutsche Wissenschaft wird sich nur freuen dass das amerikan-
ische Schulwesen ein so brauchbares Hilfsmittel gewonnen hat.

Professor Hermann osthoff, Um‘versity of Heidelberg: steht auf der
Hohe des heutigen Wissens.

Professor Harry Thurston Peck‚ Columbia College, N. Y. .· lt is no exag-
geration to say that so compact, helpful, and practical a collection of
indispensable information cannot be found elsewhere in any language
whatsoever. Even in Germany, the home of classical enchiridia¹ nothing
has yet appeared that is so satisfactory. Professor Bennett seems to
divine by instinct just what questions arise in the mind of the student,
and he here answers them in advance in a delightfully lueid and simple
fashion. . . . Everywhere the best authorities are cited; and it is certain
that to many teac‘ners‚ as well as students, the mere perusal of this little
manual will open up many new vistas‚ and will put them in touch with the
most scholarly doctrine of the day. In fact the book is one that no pro-
gressive instructor can afford to be without, as it summarizes an immense
amount of information that is of the utmost practical importance.
