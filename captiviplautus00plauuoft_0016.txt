toi-s, such as bragging soldiers, sponging parasites, and inso-
lcnt· sycophants, are held up to ridieule. As compensation
sor this narrowcr range of subjeets, appears invention of new
situations :ind of amusing complications out of which the
sanic over-recurring characters have to extricate themselves.
ln this respect the fruitful, untiring genius of the poets of
tlic ncw coniedy challenges our admiration, though our esti-
mare of them is based upon mere fragments from their plays
and upon Latin plays that are modelled after them.

Among tho poets of the new Attio oomedy, of whom there
were inore than sixty‚ the most distinguished in the judgment
of antiqnity was Menander (342-290 B.c.). Next to him,
Philemon, Diphilus, Philippides, Posidippus, and Apouodorus
of Carystus are to be named as the favorite writers of
eomedy. Of the original productions of these poets only a
few fragments have (tome down to us. We have, however,
Latin adaptations from some of their plays in the two great
coinie poets of Rome, Plautus and Terence.

Of eonrse the transition from the old to the new comedy
was a gradual one. It extended over a period of fifty years,
from the Plutus of Aristophanes (presented first in 408 and
again —this time in a revised form and without chorus and
parabasis—in 388) to about the time of the Macedonian
sovcreignty (3:38). The best known poets of this period are
Antiphanes and Alexis. thether we should look upon this
so-called middle comedy as forming a distinet type by itself
may be questioned3 bnt at any rate the division into the
old and the new is an important one, and each of these two
classes is marked by well-defined characteristic&N

The new coinedy, in its development, eoineides with the
politica] decline of Greeee and with the gradual deeay of
her art. As compared with the old eomedy, it shows in
many respects unlnistakable retrogression. As a natural
result, however. of the conditions already indicated, it is free
from that distinetly local coloring, which makes even a play
