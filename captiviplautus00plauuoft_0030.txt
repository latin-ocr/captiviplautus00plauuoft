unknown. These eight were Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulula*
ria, Captivi, Curculio, Casina, (sustollat-ia, and Epide'cus, and
these are preserved in a large number 'of extant manu-
scripts, (lating from the fourteenth and fifteenth centul-ies.
A manuscript (D), containing some of these eight plays and
also the remaining twelve, was found in Germany about
1428, and is now in the Vatican at Rome. It dates from
the twelfth century. The oldest manuscript (A) of Plautus
now extant, and indeed one of the oldest Latin manuscripts
preserved to us, was discovered by Cal-dinal Mai in 1815, in
the Ambrosian library at Milan, and is known as the Ambro-
sian palimpsest. It was written in the fourth or fifth century,
and is of course of great importancc in establishing the text,
though it lacks the Amphitruo, Asinaria„ Aulularia, and Our-
culio entirely, and preserves the other plays in a more or less
incomplete form. Two other manuscripts (B and C) were
used by Camerarius in the sixteenth century, one of these
(B, of the eleventh century) containing all of the twenty
plays, the other (of the twelfth century) only the last twelve.
A collation of a very important manuscript—viz. the one
used by Turnebus, a famous French scholar of the sixteenth
century—has recently been discovered by Lindsay.1

of the manuscript containing the twelve lost plays, ap-

of Georgius Merula, published in Venice in 1472? From
that time on there was an almost constant succession of
editions of either a part or the whole of Plautus, until
toward the end of the seventeenth century. Then inter-

doubt as to whether Lindsay's discovery really represents the read-

eight plays.
