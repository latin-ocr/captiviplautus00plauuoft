news 1 am bringing to yon that makes inc so clateil.

854. ne trustra sle: ‹lon‘c scol your-sels. Perhaps, however, this
rie-clause is subordinate.

you would εἷρπ’-8,· cupias serves as the apodosis of etsi necem, as well

ut is to be read without clision. See App.

85⁷. tu ne ε yos, you ,· ne scenis to be the asseverativc particle ηῦ,
