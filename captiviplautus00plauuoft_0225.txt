Ai‘rnsmx. 161

85-87. Rozwadowski (ll'z't-ner Studien, 13, p. 324), following
Guyet, rejects these linos, hut without sufficient reason. (1ηο is
tempted to follow Speijvr (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 1:39) in retaining the
canes, which the Mss. have at the end of 85, hy letting it begin 80,
canes sumtus) qudam», etc„ aud chnnging redierunt to rediere. But.
it seems equally plausible to suppose that cartes crept into the Mss. from
the margin, where some scribe had written it to make unmistakable
the meaning of venatici.

89. potest : see Leo, Plautia. Forsch. p. 72.

90. Editors commonly omit ire and read ilicet, needlessly altering
the Mss. Instead of reading uel ivre eura, Spcijer (Mnevwsyne, XVI.
p. 139) suggests u'l ire extra. See Skutsch, lambenkiIrzuny und
Synizese, pp. 12-17.

94. This line is commonly considered corrupt, but see my note,
with references. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. pp. 206 f.) regards
both 93 and 94 as interpolated. On the elision‚ before a following
initial vowel, of a final syllable ending in s, see Leo, Plautia. For-sch.
pp. 224 ff.

102-107. Langen regards these verses as spurious (Βεὶῑνίὶῃρ, p.
206 ; Plautia. Studien, p. 271).

102. A word must have fallen out from this verse, but it seems
impossible to restore it with any degree of certainty.

104. nullast: Brix reads n‹1cullasc,· Leo, nam nulla est‚· but
neither of these readings would have been likely to be corrupted into
the reading of the Mss. (nulla esc). Miiller reads in iuuentute ,-
Ussing, iam iuuentutis; others change the order of words. Possibly
ipsi has fallen out after sese, the scribe having looked away from his
copy after reading sese, and, upon returning‚ mistaken the -si of ipsi
for the last syllable copied. The difference between i and e in capital
Mss. is often almost indistinguishable. If ipsi originally stood in the
text, iuuentutis must have been read iziueututis as in Most. 30, Ps.
202⁶, etc.

110. The colon is commonly placed after tu. As the caesura

comes after sis, it seems more probable that tu is to be taken with ·

what follows. Brix—Niemeyer suggests the possibility of this, but in
the text retains the usual punctuation.

111. de: commonly changed to α by editors; cf. de quaestoribus
in 34.

112. his: most editors change this to is (eis), but the reading
of the Mss. seems cori-vem cf. 547-548, hic . . . isc1·c‚· 733-73-1‚ istum
. . . huic,· 1014, illic . . . hunc (see note on 1ιί in I'rol. 2).
