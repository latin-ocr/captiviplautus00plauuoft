82 NOTES. [Pion 9

the subjunctive qui-clauses, quom itself being a relative (from the
same root as qui) with some form 01 tempus understood as its ante-
cedent. For quom with the indicative, sec Uist. 115, sine trahi, quom
essomec trahor ,· Amph. 753, tu quoque eiiam insanis quom id me inier-
roqas ,· 1134, quom sum Iuppiter ‚· Capi. 216, 280, 423, etc. Even prae-
sertim quom takes the indicative, e.g. Asin. 80. The subjunctive in
the present passage may be due to the dependence of the quom-clause
upon an infinitive.

14¹7. par: originally equal, then equal to the requiremencs os the
case, i.e. suiiable, proper, natural (as here). quoi ι see note on 106.

148. aha, Hegio: for the non-elisi0n‚ see Introd. § 74, and cf.
85 f. See App.

149. dixis . . . induxis: for the more common dixeris, induxe-
ris (see note on 124). Such archaic subjunctive forms are used only
with future meanings; they never refer to the past as forms like
dixeris, induxeris, etc., frequently do (eg. in result clauses).
animum induxis: the two words are felt as constituting a single
verbal conception (brinsj ilie mind co, i.e. resolve upon, or think) and
as such may take a direct obJ'ect; here istuc is the object of animum
induxis, as well as os: diris. Cf. animum aduertere and animum
attendere, expressions which were similarly used with a direct object
and the former of which was ultimately fused into a single word,
animaduertere. tuom: see note on seruos 111 8.

151. malum : in an emphatic position 3 one might be expected to
interest himself in a friend’s prosperity‚ but his missorium—you
stand by him even in that. quom : commonly interpreted as causal,
in which use it regularly takes the indicative in Plautus (see note on
146). It is possible, however, that quom is here equivalent to an
explicative quod, ahai, the faci that. This use was entirely distinct, in
both origin and development, from the temporal or causal quom (cum)
and was always associated with the indicative. It is very common
in early Latin and is not infrequent in classical timeS, especially after
such expressions as yratulor, gratias ayo, etc. See App. If the quom
in this passage is explicative, the quom-clause will here e the direct
object of laudo: I commend your malciny your friend’s missortune
your own. The common interpretation makes it necessary to supply
an object for laudo.

152-167. See App.

152. nunc : i.e. his present plans for recovering his son promise
success. eheu: for the hiatus, see Introd. §85 f. Here, again, h
prevents elisiou. huic: referring to himself, just as a southern
