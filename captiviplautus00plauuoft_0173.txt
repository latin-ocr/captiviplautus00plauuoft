396. mora: waste os time.

rum uicem: t'n elehanan* sor ΙιοῑΙι ⁰s us, ›tuslrum twing a partitive
genitive. Tyndarus is slyty pleading sor hinist-lt, without :ti-unsina the
suspicion of Hegio. Compare such expressions as meam uicrm. in my
stead, on my account (l’laut. Most. 355), tuam uir-vm ((’ἰικ Fam. XII.
23. 3). Bennett (Lac. Graiu„ ,tppendiaa 2210, .“‚) thinks that uia-em
was originally an accusative of a1‘›p11›siti‹*›n (z as an arrhatam), and
cites the present passage and Most. 355» as supporting this view.

400. suos quoique carus: every man tomos his ozon son ‚· literally‚
his own son is (leat- to each. numquid aliud uis, etc.: a conimou
formula for closing an interview3 see note on 191.

401. me hic ualere: Tyndarus wants to put in an effective plca
for himself, but has sonte hesitation as to how he ean proceed without
arousing the suspicion of Hegio. Ile is accordingly soniewhat confused
at first by Philocrates* question, indicating, as it did. that the interview
was about to close. This confusion causes him to repeat aitnlessly the
same words he has just used (391), me hic ualere ‚· but he suddenly
rises to the occasion, and lauuches boldly out into words that will sound
innocent enough to Hegio, but which are intended as a plea to l'hilo-
crates to remernber the fidelity of his slave, thus left a prisoner. This
effort of Tyndarus is a masterpiecc. It is fully matched, however, by
the reply of Philocrates tute, etc: ιιι alone would connnonly be
emphatic; the enclitic -te makes it doubly so. The unusual emphasis
seems to imply that the information about to be given would connnonly
be furnished by the master about his slave, rather than hy the slave
about himself. In this case, however, you (slave tlmufflz. you are) are
to put on α boldsace aml cell Ιιίηι ygmrsels. dicito: sce note ou 11.
Here the act is not to take place till the supposed Tyndarus has reached
his destination.

402. fuisse: i.e. nossm'sse.

403. me aduersatum tibi: sec App.

404. gessisse morem: hare (lone the will <ermaplz'ed trith tlw
wishes) os. tamen: i.e. in spite of the aerumnae. With this posi-
tion of tamen, ct. 187, 393.
