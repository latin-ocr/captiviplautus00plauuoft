⁷64. hac: an adverb. neminis: in classical times the genitive
neminis and the ablativo nemina were no longer used; their places
were taken by nullius and nullo.

765. mei: ηιὲἶ.

become permanent. For the superstitious belief in auspicious begin-

767. redauspicandum esse . . . denuo: I must omen mysels
back aquia (Morris). Rectaaspa-andum is a new coinage of Plautus,
made for the sake of playing upon emus-piceni, which itself is not
elsewhere found.

lost. Ergasilus now thinks better of the day than he did when (in
464-467) he felt like digging its eyes out.

775. sine sacris hereditatem: the reference in sacris is to private
religious rites observed by individual families. The performance of
these rites was a sacred duty which heirs were wont to inherit. As
this duty naturally entailed trouble and expense, an hereditas sine
sacris, an inheritance which did not carry with it any such (luties, is
an expression that rame to be used of any unalloyed messing, cf. Trin.
