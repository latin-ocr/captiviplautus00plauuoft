164 APPENDIX.

may take either the subjunctive or the indicative. The difference
between the moods seems to be that the subjunctive lays particular
sti-ess upon the causal relation, while the indicative merely states the
fact, and leaves the logical bearing of the clause to take care of itself.

118, 138.

265. nescibo .· there 15 some doubt about the reading. Delaruelle
(Revue (lc Philoloyie‚ 18. p. 265) argues for qaod nesciumsl.

268. On the appending of ne to interrogative words, see Proceea-
inas os che American Plc.1'lolo[sical Assoce'alz'on for 1892, p. xviii.

2¹74. Nettleship (Leclures ancl Essays‚ p. 343) suggests Euae!
prae call Thaletem non emam Mz'lesz'am.

280. This line is considered corrupt. It is barely possible that the
usual Ᾱῖὲἶε may here be Ᾰῐῡῖε (cf. A-pleo and [spi-eliae 111 Hor. Ocl. 3. 4;
I-lalus and Italus), or that we should read Ᾰῖἑῖε.

286. quasi : it has been supposed that qnasi must be taken with
propter (ῖῑίιῖζίαε, but I can not see that it yields satisfactory sense when
so understood. Fui-thermore‚ the position of quasi is a serious objec-
tion to such an interpretation. The explanation given in my note
seems to me satisfactory, and the only one not open to objections.

290. Considered corrupt by some scholars, on account of the
indefinite use of quando. See Scherer‚ Studemund's Studien, ΙΙ.
pp. 107 f. and 129.

tioned in my note, see Skutsch, Forschunqen zur lat. Grammatilc
ancl Metrias, pp. 30, 93.

305. fueram .· it is customary to say that the pluperfect in such
cases is equivalent to the perfect or imperfect. Delbriick very prop-
erly dissents from such views‚ Verfleichencle Syntax der Indoy.

306. allerias: this is commonly changed to alerius, but see my
note.

309. nolueram: Brix conjectured noluerim ἱοιἯθ nolueram of
the Mss.‚ but this conjecture is based upon a wrong conception of
the force of the perfect subjunctive. This use of the perfect subjunc-
tive of a verb belonging to the same class as uolo is impossible for
either early or classical Latin. See note on quod . . . noluerim in 53,
and Cornell Slzalt'es z'n Classical Pliz'lolosly, VI. p. 173.

345. Skutsch (Hermes, 32, p. 92) suggests Optime for omne.
