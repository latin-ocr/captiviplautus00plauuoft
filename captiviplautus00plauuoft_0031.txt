DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMEN'I‘S, E'rc. xxv

whole of the eighteenth century practically nothing of any
importauce was done in this field. The beginning of the
present century was marked by the appearance of Bothe's
edition (1809-11) in four volulnes, the last consisting of a
commentary of 872 closely printed pages. The activity
thus renewed has continued till the present time, and has
resulted in the appearance of numerous important editions
and volumes of Plautine studies, cuhninating with the com-
pletion, in 1896, of the monumental critical edition of Goetz
and Schoell, and that of Leo. For further information
and enumeration of important editions see, for instance,
Ritschl's Opuscula, II. pp. 34 ff.; Teuffel-Schwabe, Gesclcichte
der Romischen Licet-atur (translated by Warr), ἐξ 97 and 99.

23. It should be noted that, for some time after Livius
Andronicus, dramatic persor-mances in Rome were given
only at the ludi Romani or marim& (iu September) under
the supervision of the curule aediles. Somewhat later they
formed a part likewise of the ὖίρςμιίᾡία (in April), given
under the direction of the curule aediles, of the ludi plebei
(in November), given by the plebeian aediles, and, after 211
or 212 B.c., of the ludi Apollinares (in Jllly), given by the
prae-tor urbanus. To the officials who conducted the games,
a specified sum of money was furnished by the state, for the
purpose of defraying the expense attending the occasion.
In the course of time, as the games took on a more elaborate
character, the sum donated by the state had to be increased
repeatedly, and even then those who took them in charge
frequently found it necessary to make liberal contributions
