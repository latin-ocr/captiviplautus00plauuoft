would commonly be. This is apparently a connnon phenoiuenon in
Plautus (see App.). Possimy, however, neq 111· should bc prononnced

lame: literally, serqll‘ezl sall ns Ιιιιηῃσν. The word ecfertum is oi

‚462 minus procedat: meets with less success. occeperit
(for inceperit or coeperim: attracted to the 5111)]111181118.

468. resident: re·1s1‹l‹0 originally meant το sic back (111111 elo noth-
· inq), to take a re,·sc 111111 as this was a way of celebrating a holiday,
it came to mean ιο keep or commetat«, bnt this transitive 1158 of resideo
is extremely rare. esurialis ferias: hunqez·-holi‹lccys‚· esurialis is
one of the many words coined by Plautus for humorous effects.

469. ilicet . . . crucem: the parasite business may qo and be
hanqed! ilicet: see note on 286. arti: dependent upon the
licet in ilicet. malam crucem: limit of motion after the idea of
ire in ilicet. Probably at one time the accusative was freely used
without a preposition to express 1111111 of motion, but in historical times
only comparatively few reminiscences of this use are preserved, eg.
domum, rus, names of towns and small islands, and such expressions
as exsequias ire, infitias ire, malam crucem ire, and a few others;
see Bennett, Lat. Gram. App. 311. 3. The crum was originally a
pole upon which offenders were impaled ; later, a cross to which they
were bound or nailed. 011811 mala crux is used as a stereotyped ex-
pression, felt as a single word, which in turn could be modified by
maxima, maana, ete.

produced.” A. & G. 238. b‚· Β. 176. 2; G.-L. 3:32, 333; H. 409.
iam: any'more. Lacones: parasites are thus called, apparently
because they need all the fortitude and endurance of the Spartans to
withstand the ill-treatment they get. unisubselli: a word humor-
ously coined by Plautus. The triclinium was the couch extending
111-0111111 three sides of the table for the gnests to recle’ne on ; the para-
sites frequently had to sit on a bench (subsellium) that stood by
naeu, which Plautus calls the uni-subsellium in playful allusion
to the make-up of the terni cri-clintum (cf. his similar coinage of
ueriuerbto in 568); cf. Stich. 481⁴. sc'e App. uiros: ἤρτυε-9,·
