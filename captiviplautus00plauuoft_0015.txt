HISTORY OF GREEK AND RoMAN COMEDY. ix

that comedy should for the most part be modelled ou tho
lines marked out by writers of tragedy, which already
existed in a highly developed form.

The unfortunate result of the l’eloponnesian lVar, which
broke the sels—conscious vigor of Athens, forms a turning·
point in the history of Attio coinedy. With the disappear-

died out also their interest in them; other and narrower
interests —above all, material inter-ests -——- began to engi-oss

still continued for a time to furnish the chorus, they no
longer felt the old pride in providing it with an elaborate
outfit, or in training it when equipped3 and their growing
indifference ultimately resulted in its being given up
altogether. In fact, the Plutus of Aristophanes, the latest
of the eleven plays of that author which have been pre-
served to us, shows that a decided change in this respect
has already taken place. In lieu of choral parts having an
organic connection with the play, is found between the acts
a. song that has no such connection.

handling materials. Comedy now is a tame society play,
dealing merely with the manners and customs of family life.
The abuses practised in public life no longer receive notice

attacks upon individuals have ceased; only typical charac-
