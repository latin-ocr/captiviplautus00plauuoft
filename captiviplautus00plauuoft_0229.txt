APPENDIX. 165

346. The expression “predicating characterizing‚“ found in my
notes, is adopted from Hale.

352. Mahly (Zeicschsc s. d. Oesterreichischen Gymnasien‚ 38. p.
688) suggests hic celere eat for hoc cedere ad.

359. This line has heretofore been supposed to be corrupt. The
supposed metrical difficulty is commonly obviated by writing monstra
for demonstra,· Lindsay retains demonstra, but writes (loce for (lice.
The line is probably correct as it stands ; see my note and cf. Skutsch's
“Ausblick,'' on pp. 147 ff. of his For-schunyen.

387. See note.

392. Langen (Plancin. Studien, p. 274) would reject this line on
the ground that semper secie is absum, coming from a prisoner cap-
tured only the day before (cf. 110 ff), and that such expressions as
are here found would not be used by a slave.

394. nam quidem: is commonly changed to nam equidem, on the
ground that in the eight other passages where the phrase occurs it
takes the latter form. In Ps. 260, however, C. has quidem, and all
the Mss. have quidem in the present passage. There seems no suffi-
cient ground for changing this reading.

395. Miiller (Rhein. Mus. LIV. p. 385) suggests mihi cum hoc
(nunc).

401. me hic ualere: see Langen, Plautia. Studien, p. 274 ; Speijer‚
Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 145. Nencini (Scudi Italianz' da· Filoloqia
Classica, 3. p. 84) suggests uc alibi ec ιιι te for valere et tute.

403. me aduersatum tibi: Ι see no sufficient reason for changing
this reading of the Mss. It is in perfect harmony with (nos) incer nos
fuisse ingenio haud discordabili in 402. Tyndarus is dwelling upon
the mutual relations of good-will existing between them, and neque me
aduersatum tibi is needed to carry out this idea after the preceding
neque te commeruisse culpam.

417. meus esses.- commonly considered corrupt, but see my note.

418. The reading of the Mss. is commonly altered, but. see my note.

420. uideas .· for arguments in favor of the view that the subjunc-
tive never has the power of expressing ability‚ and that this must not,
therefore, be translated by can see, see Cornell studies in Classical
Philoloyy, VI. p. 198. For a counter argument, see Bennett, ib.
IX. p. 41.

430. quo minus: one is strongly tempted to write quom minus.

430-445. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 306) regards these lines
as an interpolation.

431. caueto: editors are wont to follow Bentley in changing to
