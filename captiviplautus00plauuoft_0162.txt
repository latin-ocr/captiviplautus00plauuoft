past conditions. familiaris: ο] thesamily. As Philocrates actually
was a “son of the fainily’' in Elis, the nec secus erat, esc„ was
literally true and the condition εἰ essem . . . filius was not contrary

to fact at all. The spectators of course are thoroughly enjoying this
hoodwinking of Hegio.

274. eugepae (εὖ γε, παῖ); capital! Goocz, by Jinslo! Thalem
talento z this pun is interesting as an item of proof that the Θ of θαλῆς
was pronounced much like t‚· the only (lifference was that between
th in rac-hole and t in top. As the Latin originally had no aspirates
of its own, θαλῆς was, if we may Judge from similar words in inscrip-
tions, transliterated Tales. See note on colaphos in 88. Thales was
the earliest of the Greek philosophers‚ and one of the seven wisc men.
talento non emam: I would not tal-e (literally‚ buy) αι α talem, i.e.
if Ι could get him for a talent (I have a far better wise man in Philo-
crates). Notice that the present subjunctive here, by implication, as
a result of an omitted protasis, seems to mean I would buy (involving
the will). Strictly speaking, the idea is Ι should buy (merely a con-
clusion to an “ideal'' “less vivid future '³ condition, i.e. should clo
so, is any one were to malfe me the offer). The Attio silver talent was
worth about 81100. Α small amount, instead of this large one, would
seem more natural in such a connection, but “big talk'' was fre-
quently indulged in by slaves, just as rag-amuffins nowadays are
always ready, on the slightest provocation, to “bet a hundred dol-
larS.” Furthermore, in using talento, Tyndarus is probably thinking
of the pun more than of anything else. But see App.

275. ad: in comparison with. a meaning developed from the use
of acl to denote (lz'rectz'on toward ‚· ad sapientiam huius would strictly
mean (lirae-cinq our attention toward (i.e. is we spcak with reyard to)
this man's wz‘sclom. nimius nugator: eoreyz'ous simplecon. A
word has apparently dropped out of this line.

2¹76. ut facete . . . contulit: not how cleverly lze has adopted
(which would be quam facete), but how he has cleverly adaptecl!

277. The richer the captive and the higher his birth, the brighter
would be Hegio's prospects of exchanging him for liisQn. Philo-
crates, in the character of Tyndarus, is willing to give him every
encouragement‚ and proceeds to paint himself in very satisfactory
colors. genere: family. Polyplusio (πολύ, πλούσιος); the
Money-baqs familzb· Polyplusz'o is an adjective, modifying yenere
understood, the preceding cle still governing the case. Plautus him-
self probably wrote Poluplzcsio,· y does not seem to have been
introduced till the time of Cicero.
