liv INTuoDUCTION.

4. For subjunctive in deliberative questions: quid ·
ayo? what shall Ι clo? (instead of (said αςμωηῖθ) Cf. the
English expression, “ What do Ι do now (next) ? ''

(b) Subjunctive: 1. Absque with the ablative and esset
(foret), to represent a condition contrary to fact:
Ilien. 1022, absque te esset, were it 11οι for you.

2. Ne with the perfect subjunctive in prohibitions
is common 111 Plautus, though very rare later (except
in Cicero's Letters). It is energetie and unccremoni-
ous, and therefore colloquial.

95. Tenses :—

(a) Present .· 1. The present indicative is often loosely used
where strict accur-acy would require the future or the
future perfect: Stich. 623, deos salutabo modo .· poste acl
te continuo transeo ,· Pers 275, etiam respicis (won't you
look aroaml 9) ,· Gapt. 331, eum si reddis mihi, praeterea
unum nummum ne (lais (for εἰ reddideris, ete).

2. The present subjunctive, instead of the imper-
fect, is sometimes used in conditional sentences,
where the condition is apparently contrary to fact:
As. 393, si sit domi, (licam tibet.

(b) Funere perfect: The future perfect is frequently used,
not as a true future perfect to indicate an aet to be '
finished prior to some future time, but as an ener-
getie future to indicate prompt completion of the
act at a future time: Bacch. 211, abiero, I 'll be off,·
Tria. 1007, labet obseruare quid assat: huc concessero.
Here the force of the tense in huc concessero should
be brought out in translation by using eRFexpression
that eonnotes the idea of hurried aceomplishment, e.g.
Ι 'll step this way, I 'll dodqe in here, 01· the like. The
simple future might always be used in such a case,

but there is a very distinct differ-enee in tone between
the two tenses.
