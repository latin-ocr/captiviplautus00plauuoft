ΡΔοΒ. 16] ACT 11. scum-2 2. 95

gives a tone of permees: yon're taken me'yhty [lond cure ιῘιαι ira
shouldn't turn up missingt— I see tlmt,· this emphasis upon ‘⁶ tliat''
reproduces the emphasis brought out by the position of the clause
nc . . . essemus, which would norinally follow the word upon which
it depende (cf. 255, canet ne, etc). in quaestione: in qum».ch-
οπο esse is used in the sense of to be messium lin-rally. to he (tlte
one souym) in a secu-ch. Siinilar expressions arc common in l'lau-
tus; eg. Pers. 525 Pseud. 6⁶33 Mic. 1279; Trz'n. 278·; Cis-c. 59:3;
Cas. 530.

2⁵4. uinclis: such forms, uinclum, saeclum, periclum, etc, are the
earliest forms and are more common in Plautus than uinculum, sae-
culum, periculum. The parasitic u between tlic c and l arose from
an (unconscious) effort to facilitate the pronunciation. circum-
moeniti : with moem're for the later munire, cf. coeravit for curauit
(Ο. Ι. L. Ι. 600), ῑοεᾱοε for ludos (C. I. L. I. 567), etc. Instead of oe
in such words, oi is frequently found, and both oi and oe continued to
be used in inscriptions even in classical times.

255. The humor from this point on throughout the scene cannot
fail to be appreciated by any one who keeps in mind the general
situation,

256. cautor captus est: the cacclzer (literally‚ the ωιτη] one)
finds himself cauth. One must not mistake captus esc for a gnomic
perfect (aorist)‚ a use of the perfect tense that is first found in the
poete of the classical period, who borrowed it from the Greeks. Here
est alone is the verb, the captus being used in the predicate to express
the state.

257. an: an commonly introduces the second part of a disjunctive
question, but in early Latin and even in the poets of the classica]
period it is frequently used as a simple interrogative. The same use
is occasionally found in Livy and later prose. ut: cur would be
more common aiter causa.

2⁵8. sim mercatus: the subjunctive may be due to any one of
these causes (or to all combined), viz.: (1) to a desire to represent
the quos-clause as the indirectly reported thought suggested (by the
question) to the minds of the persons addressed; (2) to a desire to
emphasize the causa] relation of the quos-clause to the clause upon
which it depende (see App.); (3) to the fact that it depends upon
another subjunctive.

259. tibi . . . uitio uortere: co lay it up aflai-nst ,ηοω literally,
to turn ic unco you sor α saule. quia: (che saec) thac,· see note
on 153.
