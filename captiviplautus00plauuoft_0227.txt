APPENDIX. 163

193. apud: Leo (Plautin. For-sch. pp. 226 ff.) argues that the d
in apud was silent in cases like this.

trapeesitam .· this Is probably the correct form for l'lautus·, see my
note. Harrington (Pr-oceedinys ns che American l’lu'luloyical Associa-
tion for 1898, p. xxxiv.) argues that there was 110 letter z, even in
the earliest Latin alpliabet. See llenipl‘s article on The Om'yin osthe
Latin Lecters G and Z in Transactions os che Am. Phil. Ass„ XXX.
p. 24.

194. iuero .· Meifart (cle sue. exacti usu Plane.) shows that this use
of the future perfect, where one might expect the future, is found
chiefly at the end of a line or in diaeresis, and that the choice of this
tense is fiequently determined by metrical convenience. It must not,
however, be supposed that no difference was felt between the future
perfect and the future. Very often the energetic and the calm forms
of expression (eg. ¹³ I'll be 0ff” and ‘⁶ I'll qo '‘) are equally appropri—
ate in the context. In such cases, metrical convenience may deter-
mine the choice, but the difference between the tenses nevertheless
remains clear and distinct. See no'te.

199. Niemeyer (Plaucin. Studien, pp. 6 ff.) favors the reading et
erili imperio eamque inqem’is, etc. See Nettlesliip, Leccures and
Εεεαμε, p. 343 ; Karsten in Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 304. The reading oi
the Mss., however, may be correct after all (see my note).

201. Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 144) suggests Eiulc'tcio‘ne τηιὶίια
&ulis mima mera cietur. 1 have not been able to see what Schebor
says of this passage in the Journal des kais. russ. Ministeriums der
Volksaufklciruny, Sept. 1891, pp. 57-84; Oct. pp. 1-7.

211. For another view regarding the etymology of arbiter, see Fay
in Vinson‘s Revue de Iz'nquistz’que, 1898, pp. 373 ff.

217. The insertion of acque before ea seems the best of the various
emendations of this line.

243. esse nunc: nunc is commonly dropped by editors; but see
my note.

244. quom: perhaps Plautus wrote quoi. See Speijer in Mnemo-
syne, XVI. p. 144.

246. perque: tor the pronunciation perq see Skutsch, Studien,
p. 152. Lindsay apparently rejects the possibility of the scansion
ᾳιιόᾶ hostica (Journal os Philoloyy, 22. p. 4).

250. It is quite possible that we should, with Speijer (Mnemosyne,
XVI. p. 140), read ἠ nde, instead of ῑη nec.

2⁵8. The impression‚ sometimes given by grammars, that causal
qui-clauses require the subjunctive, is a mistaken one. Such a clause
