815. odos : early form for o‹I¹]r‚· Cf. arbos, labus, sor arhor, Ialmr.
An original 3 between two vowels regularly became r ; luem-‹- the origi-
nal odom’s, melosi, eto, became odoris, odori, etc„ and after the analogy

subbasilicanos z [he arcade-lounyers, sub- calling attention to the roos
above them. A basilica was a large open building, the floor space of
which was ‹livided into ais-les by rows of eolonnades, and which was
used as a hall of justice and as a public meeting place, sowing, in some
respects‚ the purposes of a modern “town 11all.” 'I'hc first basilica
mentioned as existing in Rome was the Basilica Porcia, built hy Fato
the Censor in 184 nc, the year in which Plautus died. l'lautus must
here have in mind an earlier basilica, ot' wluch no account has been
preserved. For Roman allusions in Plautus, see note ou 34.

819. qui locant caedundos agnos: i.e. who eontraet to furnish
the public with lambs that are to be fat and tender; literally‚ who
contracc sor lambs as fit to be slausshtered. The emphatic position
of locant is due to a design to contrast strongly the idea of locant with
that of danunt—what they agree to do, with what they actually tls».
For another instance of caedundus in this sense, see Aul. 567, where
Megadorus, upon being accused of having bought a lean and unsuitable
lamb for a feast, replies metiundum conduxi {tyn illum, I bouyhc (con-
tractedsor) chat lamb as nne fic sor kz‘llins] (i.e. for eating). See App.
duplam agninam danunt : (sive the public twice as much lamb (as they
ayreed to), i.e. lamb twice as old—old sheep instead of genuine lamb.
Another interpretation is commonly given, but see App. danunt:
archaic for (lanu nequinont occurs for nequeunt, and obinunt (sor
obeunt) is mentioned by Festus ; cf. also the n in cer-n-n, Ii-n-O, si-n-o‚
πα, as compared with their persects creui, lini, sini, cte.
