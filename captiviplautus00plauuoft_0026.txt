neverthelcss, abundant creativc fancy, and frequently startles
one with clover originalities. Terence is satisfieri with fidel-
it)v to his Greek model, departing froin it rai-ely, and only
when lio feels tliut liis artistic purpose requires it. Plautus
is given to oxaggerated puns, striking effects, sharp con-
tras-ts. Terence ainis at truth, accuracy, and artistic finish.
The style of Plautus is 'reckless and extravagant, of the do-
all and dure-ull sort, aud his words are often iinported from
the Greek or manufactured to suit the occasion. The style
of Terence is inore sober and sedate, and his words are
those sanctioned by good Latin usage. Plautus can inflict
upon an individual such a name as Vaniloquidorus Virginis-
vendonides Nugiepiloquides Argentumexterebronides Te-
digniloquides Nununosexpalponides Quodsemelarripides
Nunquameripides (Pers. 702„ Terence would consider
such word-making beneath his dignity. Plautus aimed at
making fun, sacrificing or subordinating everything to
this one purpose3 Terence aimed at drawing a true picture
of Greek life in the purest colloquial Latin, so far, at any
rate, as Greek life was correctly portrayed in the poets from
whom he drew his material. In general, the excellences of
Plautus are largely such as depend upon spontaneity of
genius3 those of Terence are the result of thought and
study and painstaking in reproducing, in the most artistic
form, the excellences of his Greek models. v
