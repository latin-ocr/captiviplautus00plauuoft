directly upon another subjunctive, commonly takes tlw sam«= mood τις
in direct discourse, eg. 720; Ter. ΙἸιυι-ηι. 4, ss, 21, 251, 42⁴, -ι81;
Adelph. 14, 67 (bis), etc.

568. tu, etc. : emphatic, in you, no dnum, is found (ι man, who,
eoe. enim: see note on 5:34. qui superes: ‹clu› sur-posses, a
predicating characterizing clause of the developcd type (clause of
characteristic) ; see note on 12. ueriuerbio : a word coinecl appa-
rently by Plautus.

⁵69. uera . . . conuincas: pernen-c (literally‚ orm-comp) the crach.
uanitudine: empty lies.

570. agedum: come now. This enclitic -clum is akin to the dum
which means while, etc„ and was probably, in its origin, nn accusa-
tive expressing duration of time, α moment. With imperatives it
came to be used merely to emphasize the command. (Ὺ. the German
mal. einmal with imperatives; eg. warte mal, just waic, waic σιμ-ι).
em: well! here you are! calling attention to the fact that he has
complied with the request Just addressed to him.

571. Cannot be read metrically as it stands.

573. Alidem z for in Aliclem,· see Introd. ξ 92 (cl).

5⁷4. quem patrem, qui: loosely constructed, as frequently in
colloquial speech ; the real meaning is “father '³ (say you) osone who
is a slave ? and the qui has for its antecedent the genitive that is sug-
gested in the quem. The father of a slave was not legally recognized
as such ; a slave was designated not as the filius of any-body, but as

the seruos of his master. et tu quidem: you, too, sor ιΙιαι mat-
ter. Notice the elever manner in which 'lyndarus turns the taunt ot·
Aristophontes.

575. fuisti: are no lonyer; literally‚ were, see notes on 243, 516.
iore: sc. libertum· while the preceding liber suisti seems best trans-
lated by are no lonqer free, it strictly means, of course, you were sree
(the virtual meaning represented by the translation being due merely
to the contrast with present time suggested by the tense); the con-
struction sore (liberum) is therefore a natural one.

576. reconciliasso: equivalent to reconciliazaeero, shall have
brouyht back; for the meaning of this word, see note on 33; for
the form, that on 124 (saxis).

577. gnatum: sc. esse, which has possibly dropped out after
anatum, as the line is not complete as it stands.

⁵78. Tyndarus purposely misconstrues what Aristophontes meant
by liberum. Liberum: this suggested identification of Tyndarus
with Bacchus is a touch that the audience would be sure to appreciate.
