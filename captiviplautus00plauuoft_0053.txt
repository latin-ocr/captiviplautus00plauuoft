PROS( ›DY. xlvii

thesis, or after the arsis, or between separate feet. The
following occur-rences may here be 1ioted:¹—
(a) In the diaeresis of a tetrameter, e g.

780, spemque} m(e) ῦὸ Ι hftnc ηἷῖηιῖῐιιῑι aecz'rnsstm) ἶιὶἓρ ιῖιιῡηι ςῖὸίιηι.
331, eum εἷ reddis Ι mim praec( rea ᾱηϊιηι ηϊιηιηιῖιηι ne: dicis.

(b) In the caesura of an iambic sensu ins, e g.
709, sed ηιᾶἱὲη(ε) id sde'fflm 51·1]ῖινᾶ[νέ9-Ρέ33ᾰηιέ.
(c) At the end of the fourth foot of an iambic senarius, e.g.

sues moriuntur ‹itzyz‘na Ι acerrume.

(d) In the fifth foot of an iambie senarius, eg.

93, ῑιᾰ ηᾶηο balmen-<inc Ᾰριῡιῑ ι cam Ᾰιῡῑε.

(e) Elsewhere when there is a deeided pause in the sense, e.g.
139, ΝΞ fle. Er. fiqbnoe) ἶῖλῖϊιιη min fleam? Effln Ι non diaestledm.

It'occurs further, at points in the verse not covered
by the enumeratiou thus far made.

. (f) Before or after interjections (especially monosyllabie
interjections).

(9) After pyrrhie or iambie dissyllables‚ e.g.

950, &bx estis, u68?1 isse) ᾶοιῖιιῖιηι, 1 Τῇηιῐᾶν(τιυι) Ῐιῑιο arleti-wite.

(h) In aceented monosyllables‚ a final m was sometimes not
elided before a following vowel, and a final diphthong
or long vowel xvas merely shortened, instead of being
altogether elided (see under ⁴‘ semi-hiatus,'' ξ 37 (e)).
As the syllable involved always has the ictus, it is
probable that the phenomenon is due to this fact.

841, Idm ξ9(ο) ἔτι σῦνΡόζν(ε) existam) &mnis Ι τηᾶεἴιῑᾶε τηιΐενὸΙνϊὶηι
tibi.

⁷05, ‘2¹1³AE ιιὲνα <westsear im quo'i ὅερενᾱηι dabam.

807, Tam ρῑειῡνεε ι screiflpascz, ι qui alant χῖιιγῐινῑιὸῑῖε sices.

¹ cases formed by initial h after a final vowel or m, as Birt has shown,
should probably not be regarded as instances of hiatus (see ἓ 74).
