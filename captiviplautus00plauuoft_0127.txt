PERSONAE.

Tne early Greek comedy seldom employed more than three actm-s,
but after the chorus was abolished this number was often excecat-d.
With the exception of the Cistellaria and the Scimus, the plays of
Plautus always require at least four ; those of Terence require at least
five. In the Captivos four actors are necessary; among these the parts
might be distributed as follows ι -

1 Hegio.
{23 Philocrates, Aristophontes, puer.
(3) Tyndarus, Philopolemus, the lor-arius who speaks in Act I. Scene 2st

(4) Ergasilus, Stalagmus, the lorarz'as who speaks in Act 11. Scene l,
and Act III. Scene 5.

Besides these, supernumeraries would be necessary, e.g. in Act II.
Scene 1.

The names in fabulae palliatae are commonly Greek names with
Latin forms. Such names are usually chosen as will in themselves
convey some idea of the characters to whom they belong. For in-
* stance, in the present play :—

Ergasilus indicates “the worke1·'’ (ἐργάζομαι), who ‘⁴ means busi-
ness'’ and is not to be trifled with. The reader should picture him iu the
ordinary dress of a parasite, i.e. in blackor gray garments of outlandish
style, and whatever ‘⁴ extras '‘ might add to his ridiculous appearance.

Hegio, “the prominent citizen,'' “the leading man'' of the place
(cf. ἡγέομαι). This actor accordingly wears, with befitting dignity,
the usual dress of a well-to-do Greek.

Philocrates, “fond of ruling.'' Plautus himself probably spelled
this name Pilocrates5 see note ou Talem in 274.

Aristophontes, “killer of ehiefs.⁷’ For the l‘lautlne spelling, see
note on 274.

Philopolemus, “ the lover of war’' (φίλος, πόλεμος). For the
Plautine spelling, see nofe on 274.

Stalagmus, ‘⁶ the dropper. ' ’
