166 APPENDIX.

caue tu. Nettleship (Leccures and Essays, p. 343) suggests canito
(see Serv. on Aen. IV. 409). 11 is barely possible, however, that the
second syllable 01 a word 01 three or more syllables may be shortened,
even when it is long by nature (see Introd. ξ 84, 4). Λ1 any rate,
such phenomena are so frequently presented by Mss. that one cannot
lightly dismiss them as not worth considering. See the readings 01
the Mss. in Aul. 482, 71ιὲηόνο ,· 500, herile ‚· Epid. 3:38, quieto ‚· Mero. 841,
esc capit& Pseud. 498, (ῖηιῦνῖ8,· Stich, 700, (wilica, etc. Esch (De
Plauti correptione secundae syllabae vocabulorum polysyllaborum,
qaae mensura iambica incipiunt) gives twenty-three such instances of
shortening in Plautus, in trisyllabic words alone (though a few 01
these instances do not properly belong in 1118 list), and many similar
instances in longer words. When the second syllable is long by posi-
tion, a similar shortening is very common. Esch gives seventy—seven
such instances in trisyllabic words 111 Plautus, and many others in
longer words. Under these circumstances, Ι have allowed the reading
01 1118 Mss. to stand, though not without misgivings. See Skutsch,
Iambenkiirzunq und Synoeese, p. 123 Studien zur Plaut. Prosodie‚
p. 108; Leo, Plautia. Forsclz. p. 292.

432. tc' me'd ssd& micci: the te is commonly discarded but, in my
Judgment, without sufficient reason.

485. te laic .· commonly written ted hic to avoid the supposed hia-
tus, but the reading 01 1118 Mss. may be correct. See my note.

444. This verse has been variously emended, but is probably
correct as it stands. See note.

458. modo captiuos: Mffller (Rlzez‘n. Mus. LIV. p. 385) regards
Fleckeisen's modo (acl) captiuos as ⁴² absolut sicher'' ; cf. 126.

466. On the elision 01 s before a following initial vowel in Plautus,
see Leo, Plauti η. Forsclz. pp. 224 ff. For another possible explanation,
see Spengel in Philolossus, XXXVII. p. 436. Editors have commonly
altered the reading of 1118 Μ88. 11818 10 nec mayis, to make it conform
to supposed metrical requirements. Similar changes have been made
in numerous other cases of similar character. Leo now shows that the
Mss. are probably right after all. Ὗ

471. unisubselli: frequently changed to imi subselli‚ but even 11
11118 made the interpretation easier, the evidence in favor 01 1118 read-
ing 01 1118 Mss., supported, as it 18, by the Mss. in Stich. 488, is so
strong that such an arbitrary alteration seems unjustified.

4⁷9. Editors commonly abandon the Mss. on account 01 1118 sup-
posed violation 01 metrical requirementffi but see note on mamis)
ecfertum 111 466, and Leo's Plautia. Forsch. p. 251.
