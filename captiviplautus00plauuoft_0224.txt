11. See note.

39. For illc as a pronunciation of illic, see Skutsch, Studien zur
Plaucc'n. Prosodie, p. 113 ff.

53. On the force of the perfect subJunctive in expressions of contin-
gent futurity, see Cornell Js'cudzes ἱη Classical th'lolofsy, VI. There I
have shown that the noluerim in this line cannot be classed with such
expressions. The perfect tense in such future uses of the subjunctive
denotes enerssett'c action promptly φεῦγον-γηθεῖ ancl prompuy completed.
Accordingly, no verb whose meaning is opposed to this idea is found
with the perfect tense in this use. With uos quod monitos noluerim
in the sense of which I have wanted glou advised os, ef. 309, hoc te mo-
nicum nolueram ; Ce'sc. 299, tc uolo monicum. With this use οῖ’ a past
tense of uolo where uelim would make equally good (though entirely
different) sense, cf. also 430, quo minus dixi quam uolui de ce animum
aduorcas uolo.

72—73. The repetition of scortum in 73 has caused most editors to
suspect a corruption in the text. The repetition is sufficiently aecounted
for by Ergasilus' evident desire to lay all possible emphasis upon the
point that he is making. He is contending that, in spite of what the
derisores say, it is perfectly appropriate that he should be called
‘⁶ Scorcum'' ,· sor, he says, it is his scortum that che lover incohes, when
he tlzro‘ws tlte (lice—it is his scortum, I repeat ; isn't α scortum then
‘⁶ inuocacwn ’Ψ Why chen object to my being] called Scortum ?

74. Scortum is inserted by Bentley after inuocabant. 1 h'ave not
incorporated it into the text, but I believe it to be correct, for the fol-
lowing reasons: (1) it is certain that a word has dropped out ; (2)
scortum has to be mentally supplied, in any case, to make sense, even
if omitted from the text ; (3) the preceding lines show that the
speaker is making the most of this word by constant repetition and by
centering the thought upon it; (4) the word would easily be omitted
by a scribe, who, glancing up from his copy for a moment, after reading
inuocatmn would, upon turning again to his copy, mistake the —tum of
scortum for the last syllable copied, and would begin writing again
with an non, etc. The loss of <esst est), supplied fflamerarim,
could not be so easily accounted for.

77-83. Karsten (lllnemosyne, XXI. p. 296 f.) regards 7 7-79 and
rebus . . . miseri, in 82 and 83, as interpolations.

¹77. This line is commonly regarded as spurious (see, for instance,
Spengel, Philologus 37, 421 3 BriX, ad loc. ,· Langen, Plautin. Studien,
p. 271), but, it seems to me, without sufficient reason. Niemeyer de-
fends it (Zez'tschre'st s. Gymnasmzwesen for 1885, p. 361).
