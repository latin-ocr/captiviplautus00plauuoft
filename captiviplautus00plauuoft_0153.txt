202. si . . . utare, adiuuat: for soine reason not yet understood, a
condition in which the subject of the verb is an indelinitc sna-ond pcr-
son takes the subjimctive, though tho apodosis takes the indicativo.
When the subject is an indefinite chit-d person (cg. quis), on thc other
hand, the protasis takes the indicative.

203. This line offers a good illustration of thc two connnon uses
of at: (1) to introduce an objection to sonic one's statenwnt. (2) to
introduce the reply to such an objection. nos pudet quja: such
passages as idne pudet te ιμιίιι (Epid. 107) inakc it probablc that thc
quia-clause is a substantive clause and that qum here means thre frid
that. See note on 153. cum catenis: where wc should say in

it differs from solui sinac in calling attention to the state resulting froin
the act, rather than to the act itself. emerit: the niood may bc duc
to attraction, or it may be due to the musal-adversative idea involved ;
the quos . . . emerit gives the reason for saying jai-meac (ιί would be veza-
tious, etc, since he has paz'd money sor them), bnt it has at the same
time an adversative relation to si solutos sinat (is he should luc chem
loose aad incur the risk os los-ins] chem, e'n—ss'n'ce us tlte ..QLQ they

such as might actually be interpreted as independent. Eg. 'ri-r. Phor-m.
