Paua 17] AC'r 11. SCENE 2. 99

278. unum : i.e. the one above all others.

279. ipsus: common in early Latin for ipse. hic: like tu in
2·a·o‚ is felt as subject in the most general indefinite sense. no particu-
lan-verb being present to the mind. An accusative is often used ω
denote the obJect of action in a similarly indefinite sensc; eg. Ter.
Phorm. 755. Quid illam alteram Β ab summis uiris : to be taken
with the passive verb (is held in lautior) suggested by quo tumore est.

280. tumigitur: in that case then. quom . . . gratiast: for
the moed, see note on 146. The metrical structure of this line is
doubtful. It seems barely possible that we should read Eleis. See
App.

281. quid diuitiae: on the case of (ῑίιιῐιῖαρ, see note on hic in
279. unde excoquat sebum senex: this is a play upon opiniae,
which originally meant fiii. The entire line might be rendered: Ηυιο
about his pur-se >³ Is ic a suc one ? Fal enozeyli co keep him in yreuse
as lonq as he lires. senex : in appositiou with the sufficet, till old
aqe; literally, as αη old man.

282. pater : for the construction, see note on hic in 279.

283. id Orcum: notice the force of the position of id, lhal's α
matter which, etc.

284. philosophatur: I have followed the custom of editors in
writing ph instead of p, though it is probable that ph was not used
in the time of Plautus. See notes on 88 and 274.

285. quid . . . nomen: what was his name 2 litei-ally, what was
unio him as name. “What name?'' would commonly be quod
nomen? Thensausocrysonicocrysides: a name manufactured
from θησαυρός, treasury ‚· χρυσός, 9οΖιῖ ,“ νίκη, ἰ’ίείονῃ ,· χρυσός, [feld ,· and
the patronymic termination -ieles .· (r'olzly Goldman, Jr.

286. uidelicet: clearly enouyh, froin uidere licet, literally. ic is
permittecl co see (cf. scilicet and ilicet, from scire licet and ire licet).
inditum id nomen quasist: that has been applied to him as his name,
so to speak (as α sort os name)? Hegio naturally enough infers that.
such a. compound could not be his real name, but must have been
used as a substitute for it, in allusion to the riches he had acquircd.
Quasi is often thus used to apologize for an expression that might
seem out of place (nomen in this instance) ; cf. philosophia areium
omnium quasi parens (Cic. cle orac. Ι. 3. 9). See App.

28⁷. immo edepol: see note on immo in 209. ipsius: ipse
regularly implies contrast3 here the avarice that characterized the
father himself, implying a desire not to make such a charge against
the son. audaciam: (freed (for money). The word is con-
