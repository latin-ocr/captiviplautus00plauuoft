DIVISION OF PLAYS INTO ACTS AND SCENES.

33. A division of dramas into acts was already known in
the time of ‘l'lantns and Terence, but it does not as a rule
seem to have been clearly marked by the writers them-
selves. It was left rather to the discretiori of the theatrica]
managei· to introduce intermissions at suitable places in the
play. This is perhaps the reason why the manuscripts, ,at
least all the oldest of them, have no division into acts.
Definite divisions were, however, established by the gram-
marians and the commentators of antiqnity (though these
sometimes differ among themselves), and five was settled
upon as the proper number of acts for a drama (cf. Horace,
A. P. 189 f.).

34. The division into soenes, on the other hand, is very
old. It was customary to place before each scene a com—
plete list of all the characters to appear in that particular
scene. In the copies which formed the basis of onr manu-
scripts, each character who had anything to say was de-
noted by a letter of the Greek alphabet, which letter served
also in the text to designate that character. For the divi-
sion into soenes, two principles seen] to have been followed
in onr manuscripts. According to one of the ‚ a new
scene is formed by the exit or the entrance of a single
actor. Exceptions to this rnle are formed by cases in which
a person leaves the stage only for a moment, or in which the
persons who remain behind have little to say, and that of
no importance, until the entrance of another actor, or other
