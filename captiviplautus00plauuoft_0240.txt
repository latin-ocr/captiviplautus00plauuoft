Α Latin Grammar.

By Professor CHARLES E. ΒΕΝΝΕΤΤ, Cornell University. 12mo‚cloth,
282 pages. Price, 80 cents.

N this book the essentia] facts of Latin Grammar are pre-
sented within the smallest compass consistent with high
scholarly standards. It covers not only the work of the pre—
paratory school, but also that of the required courses in college
and university. By omitting rare forms and syntactical usages
found only in ante-Classical and post-classical Latin, and by
relegating to an Appendix theoretical and historical questions,
it has been found possible to treat the subject with entire ade-
quacy in the compass of 250 pages exclusive of Indexes. In
the German schools‚ books of this scope fully meet the exacting
demands of the entire gymnasial course, and those who have
tried Bennett's Grammar fmd that they are materially helped by
being relieved ot the mass cx useless and irrelevant matter which
forms the bulk of the older grammars. All Latin texts for read-2
ing in secondary schools, recently issued, contain references in
the notes to Bennett's Latin Grammar.

Professor William A. Houghton, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Malne.
The Grammar proper is admirably adapted to its purpose in its clearness
of arrangement and elassiflcation, and in its simplicity and precision of
statement, giving definitely just what the pupil must know, and not crowd—
ing the page with a mass of matter that 100 often disheartens the young
student instead of helping him¹ 1 trust it will corne into general use, for
I think sor the reasons just given, and because of its moderate compass
and attractive appearance, students are likely to get more practica] gram-
matical knowledge out of it than they generally do from the larger
grammars.

John F. Peck, Oberlin Academy, Oberlin, Olzio: Bennett's Latin Grammar
was adopted as a text-book in Oberlin Academy in 1897. It is proving
itselt' a very satisfactory text-book and increasingly popular. e teachers
of Latin in Oberlin Academy are thoroughly satisfied with the ook and
lind it exceedingly helpful in their work.

The critic, Feb. 29, 1896. The book is a marvel of condensed, yet clear
aud sorcible, statement. The ground covered in the treatment of forms

and syntax is adequate for ordinary school work and for the use of fresh-
men and sophomores in college.
