108 Norns. [Pron 22

377. omnem rem: the whole story, loosely added as an appositive
to the quid-clauses. ο

379. patrem: the reference of this word in this and the following
lines is intentionally left ambiguous.

380. rebitas: from re and Ιιῖιῦνο (ιο (ιο) ; adbibere, pervicere, inter-
bitere, and other compounds also occur in Plautus. See note on
arbiter in 211. si non rebitas: the protasis of dem. Notice the
loose use of the present tense. ut. . . dem: with the understandiny
chat. Bennett calls such clauses “ sti1›ulative.'’

382. The hidden meaning should not be missed.

383. animum aduortas uolo: such uses originally consisted of
two independent sentences, animum acluorcas ! nola, pay attention! I
wish ic. See note on 360.

385. adhuc locorum: hitherto ,· literally, up to this point of time,
locorum being a partitive genitive, and here referring to time, rather
than place3 cf. postea loci, afterward (Sall. Juss. 102); interea loci,
meanwhile (Ter. Eun. 126); ad id Iocorum, hitherto (Sall. ι1ης).
63. 6); post id Iocorum, afeerward (l'lant. Cas. 120); inde loci, since
then (Lucr. 5. 437). ,

386 f. ut. . . petam: explanatory of the faciam ‚· for faciam ut
petam one might expect merely petam. in rem tuam: see note
on 338.

387. This line is corrupt. Perhaps Plautus wrote idque persequar
instead of 'id persequar-que.

389. salutem dicito: remernber me to.

392. me honore honestiorem. . . fecit: has shown me unusual
consideration ‚· literally, has mado me more honored than honor. Again
the double meaning should be noted. Hegio would understand the
words to mean more honored than honor itsels, but Tyndarus chooses
words that may also mean ‘more honored than my real station as α slave
callsfor. See App.

393. ne praecipias: for this mild form of prohibition, see note on
331. tamen: i.e. even without instructions from you.

394. nam quidem: the only instance in Plautus ote-cnam quidem
instead of nam equidem ; see App. nisi quod: aside from the fact
that. Nisi in such expressions was originally felt as introducing a
conditional idea, and the explicative quod-clause 'was the subject of the
verb to be supplied with nisi. The expression originally meant is it
were (φνας, is) not a fact that, or something similar, but it drifted away
