130 NOTES. [Pron 38
.

644. quin: as in 643. magis hoc certo certius: more surely
“sur sure ” than ἱΙιῐε, the cerco being merely a repetition of the pre-
ceding adverb. Such a ‹louble comparative as massis certius is
not uncommon in colloquial language ; cf. Sce'ch. 704, mot-qis ‹lulcz‘us‚·
Men. 97⁸ ; Rueck. :300 ; and Shakspere's ‘⁶ the more better assurance,'‘
(Midsummer Nisslzc's Dream, ΙΙΙ. 1. 21), and “the most unkindest
cut. of all ⁷' (Julius Caesar, III. 2. 187).

645. inde . . . a puero puer: from che time when we were boys
tossetlzm·,· litei-any, thence from α bey, a boy (himself). The phrase
a puero is merely a closer definition of inde. puer: in apposition
with Philocrates. This construction would commonly indicate that
Philocrates is still a boy at the time the sentence is ,uttered, but the
appositional construction is sometimes loosely used ; cf. Cic. de senect.
9. 30, Metellum memini puer ita bonz's esse uiribus, where puer does
not indicate that the speaker is a boy, but that he remembers that, .
when he was a boy, Metellus had, etc.

647. corpore: complexim.

648. crispus, cincinnatus: with hair curly and well cm‘mped.
Crispus refers to hair naturally curly 3 cincinnatus to flowing locks
artificially cui-led. conuenit: ic tallias, i.e. your words correctly
describe the appearance of the supposed Tyndarus, who has been sent
to Elis.

649. ut quidem hercle, etc.: that I, consozmcl it all, came out
to-dags under aicspz'ces most unfortunate! Such a clause is exclama.-
tory iu feeling, but is conceived of as also expressing the result (hence
ut) of circumstances; cf. Ter. Phorm. 772, ut stultissime quidem . . .
rem (sesserz'mns l that we have manaqed thinsjs like consummate fools!
The oct-clause in our passage is sometimes explained as depending
upon conuenit, which Tyndarus is then supposed to use for his own
purpose with the sense of it is αρν-θεά, but after conuenit in this sense
we should have had me . . . processisse instead of uc . . . processerim.
Conuenit ut with the subjunctive might express agreement as to
purposes that shall be attained‚ or determination that shall be carried.
out, but not agreement as to facts or events that are past. in
medium . . . pessume processerim: the phrase in me ium pro-
cedere is used of a man going out from the privacy of his home in the
morning to begin his day's work. There was a common superstition
that a man began each day either under good or under bad auspicem
the influence of which lasted throughout the day ; cf. “getting out of
the wrong sicle of the bed.'' Pes-sume here has reference to these aus-
pices , cf. Stich. 459, auspicio hercle hodie optumo exiui foras ,· Epid.
