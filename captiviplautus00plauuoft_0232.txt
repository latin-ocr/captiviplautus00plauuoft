168 APPENDIX.

¹ tation in my notes was suggested by Fay (Classical Review for 1894, p.
391), who, however, accepts insputatur as a probable correction. He
extends his interpretation to ins-putarim· and insputari in 553 and 555.
111 this he may be correct, but his objection to the transitive use
of imputo, though serious, is not insui-mountable. Other similar
compounds are found with the accusative, e.g. inclamo, inuoco (liter-
ally, lo call upon 01· at).

558. Commonly considered corrupt, but see my note. Leo retains
090, but indicates an impossible scansion.

597. The Mss. read alra pix. Havet (Revue de Philoloqie, 18. p.
242) argues for acra assim pix.

653. This line is commonly considered corrupt, but see my note.
On the use of —ne in the sense of uero, indeed, see WVaraen, Am. Jour.
osPliz'l. ΙΙ. pp. 50 ff.

694. Apparently corrupt. The line can be read metrically as it
stands only by scanning intel-(lico, which seems impossible.

699. This line may have originally ended in redum, the bene est then
belonging to the beginning of the next line ; see Speijer in Mnemosyne
(1888), p. 152, and cf. 686, 923, and Prol. 43.

749. The reading of the Mss. is retained. See my note.

771. For other instances of pompa, see Knapp‚ Classical Review‚
X. p. 427.

79].. For the proof that the Romans felt a distinct and important
difference between the perfect and present tenses in expressions refer-
ring to the future, see Cornell Slucltes in Classical Philoloqgs, VI.

800-802. See Karsten (lc).

818-822. Regarded by Karsten as an interpolation.

819. Editors commonly read dupla instead of duplam, and inter-
pret the line as meaning who have. lclmbs killed ancl then offer lamb sor
sale al double the price (1.6. at double the price it is really worth).

This interpretation is open to the following objections : ——-

(1) Lccniz' means Machor& i.e. those who with their own hands
slaughter animals ; but the interpretation in question makes it neces-
sary to suppose that the butchers employed some one else to do their
butchering.

(2) The positions of locant and danum! clearly show that these
two words are strongly contrasted. The interpretation in question
disregards this contrast altogether.

(3) There is 110 authority of any kind for the reading dupla. The
manuscript authority is unaniinously in favor of duplam, and such
