1 70 APPENDIX.

865. deum .· Ι retain the reading of the Mss. See my note.

882. iam diu: Gray (Proceedinys os the Cambv·i(,lye Phil. Soc.
for 1888, p. 6) revives Wagner's emendation, tam modo.

892. Brix-Niemeyer takes etiam with quom in the sense of even
when. Kirk (Am. εῙοην. of Pha. XVIII. p. 26) takes it in the sense
of still. But its position favors my interpretation. If Plautus did
not intend etiam to bc taken with sancte, he would be guilty of un-
necessary ambiguity in assigning it to this position in the sentence.

901. I have followed the Mss. in making a new scene here, though
editors commonly follow Spengel (JS'cenenticel, pp. 278 ff.) in recog· ·
nizing no division.

923. reducem: on the derivation and form of this word, see
Fleckeisen, Neue ‹salu-bucher for 1893, p. 196 f. and for 1895, p. 277 f.
In the present passage it is customary to write reclamem, but this is
against all manuscript authority, and against the uniform usage of all
poets from Naevius on, including Plautus himself (ci, in the present
play, 437, 686, 931; also Prol. 43). In Rud. 909 there is similarly
no authority for reddzteem, though editors adopt this reading. The
simplest way to remedy the metre is to assume, with Fleckeisen, that
te belongs after tuo.

927. haec . . . repertast .· probably re has fallen out before the re
of repertast.

964. Perhaps Plautus wrote istaec (Schmidt) instead of ista‚· or
ac elic (Camerarius) instead of (lz'e.

993. Vos is commonly inserted, quite arbitrarily, after si.

1006. On the use of( (sacceus and filla& see Κὸὴω, quaestiones
Plautinae Terentianaeqae, pp. 6 ff.

1014. For illzc, Bach conjectures ipse (S'cndemund' s Studien, ΙΙ.
pp. 433 ff. ), but see my note. ·

1021. Havet inserts ta after sed. Perhaps vero was originally
written after oro. See Speijer, Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 155.

1022-1023. One of these lines is commonly reJ'ected, but, it seems
to me, without adequate reason. See my note.
