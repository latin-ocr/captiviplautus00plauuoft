ARGUMENTUM.

The ‹tryzcmoenca prefixed to the plays of Plautus are not the produc-
tions oi that poet, but were written in a latm- age, during a revival of
interest in archaie Latin. See Introd. §zlL Such brief summaries
were also written for other authors (eg. for the different books of
Vergil's Aenez'd and for the plays of Terence, by Sulpicius Apollinaris
in the second century Aa). ), the prosody and the language of the author
in hand being in each case carefully imitated.

1. captust: i.e. captus est,· final s after a short vowel was very
faintly pronounced in early Latin. Captus esc would therefore easily
become capcu' est and then (by prodelision) captust. With this dis-
appearance of the initial e, compare, e. g. opcumwnsc, for optumum est,
111 10; domist for (lomi est, 111 29; the English z't’s for ic is, etc. On
the position of captust, see Introd. ξ 99. Here captust sounds the key-
note of the entire play, and accordingly takes the most prominent
place for the verb. pugna Hegionis: probably not a case of hiatus.
Η 5661115 to have been capable of preventing elision aud of ‘⁶ making
position ⁷' after a final consonant. See Introd. ξ 74.

2. seruos : for the form, see Introd. ξ 86 (α).

4. A word has apparently fallen out of this verse. See App. stu—
dens ut z one of the few instances in which studeo is followed by an uc-
clause.

5. If the reading is correct, there is hiatus after inibi. filium:
i.e. Tyndarus.

6. is: i.e. Tyndarus. suo: with synizesis, szTo ; see Introd. §78.
uersa: i.e. mutata.

‘'7. amittatur: here equivalent to cliwizittatur. See note on 36. The
subject is dmninus, i.e. Philocrates 111 the disguise of a slave. ipsus:
for the Classical ipse.

8. is: i.e. Philocrates. fugitiuom: see Introd. ξ 86 (a).

9. quoius: for the classical cuius ‚· Introd. §86 (b). alium: i.e.
Tyndarum ; alium is here equivalent to alterum.

PROLOGVS.

On the prologues to the plays of Plautus⁷ see Introd. ξ 19.

Τ116 νὸἶε of prologue seems to have been usually taken by one of the
younger actors or by the managei· of the company, who was attired
for the occasion in a particular costuine. thile the whole burden of
the prologues of Terence consists of answers to the unkind criticisms
