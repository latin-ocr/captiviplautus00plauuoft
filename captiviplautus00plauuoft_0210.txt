146 NOTES. [Plan 49

866. uidere: i.e. uideris. miquidem esurio: z‘t’s sor mysels
(in my own 'inem-est) ιΙιαι I’m lzunyry. Ergasilus, in J'est‚ pretends to
misunderstand Hegio's mihi as lnodifying esurire (instead of uidere,
as Hegio intended). Notice that mi in miquc‘dem is short; cf. siquidem
(920).

867. tuo arbitratu: as you please, αι your [alea-sure, expressing a
willingness to acknowledge the truth of the last words of Ergasilus.
facile patior: ineant by Hegio in thc sense of l readily (franc ic, i.e.
I know you well enough to grant that, when it comes to eating, you
are “ in it'' for yourself only. cousuetu’s puer: Ergasilus pre-
tends to understand Hegio's words (facile pacior) iu an obscene sense,
I readz'ly submit, and replics [suppose so ,· you Ιιαιῐ tlte habit when a boy.

868. Iuppiter. . . perdant: the use of perdant ( perdat, perduint,
etc.) in curses, though extremely common, is confined almost exclu-
sively to make-believe curses, that are not really meant by the speaker;
hence the present tense is regularly used instead of the perfect3 see
note and App. on 172. te hercle : Ergasilus begins as though about
to utter a curse against Hegio, in reply to the latter's curse against
him. All of this is of course good-natured raillery, and Ergasilus, after
an insinuating pause, substitutes for the expected perdant an utterance
of a very different character3 ce becomes the subject of assere, instead
of the obJ'ect of perdant. aequomst: an English-speaking person
would be likely to say, >it would be proper, but it must not be supposed
that est in such an expression was felt as we feel “would be.'’ The
Latin cst means merely is,· 111 the present passage, for instance, the
conception is the proper chiny ιο clo is ιο ιΙιαηΙε me (chcmks are due me
instead of curses). See note on 61.

870. nunc tu . . . places ε i.e. I am now ready to accept your invi-
tation. Heretofore Ergasilus has had his doubts about the character of
the (linner he was likely to get at Hegio's (cf. 179 ff. and 497) and has
been waiting and hoping for a more promising invitation. Now, how-
ever, he feels sure that the good news he is about ‘to announce to Hegio
will incline the latter to give him of his best. post tempus : behind
tz'me; Hegio means that his missor-tunes have left hfin in no mood for
a feast. —N

871. igitur: connected with the demonstrative pronoun is, and
originally meaning, in ιΙιαι case, αι that time ‚· the si-clause seems
here to be in apposition with the demonstrative idea in igitur:
in thesollowz'nss case, viz. if I had come some time ayo, then, etc.‚ cf.
Mil. 772, quando habebo, isse'tm· dabo. Ιῃίιῑιν is sometimes used in
connection with deinde and demum ,· eg. Rud. 930, ubi liber ero, iqitur
