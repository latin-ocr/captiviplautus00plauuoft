stage the plays of former poets. It was but natural that
many changes should be made in those ‹›l‹l plays to make
thern better suited to the altered conditions= under whi‹·h
they were to be reproduved. 'l‘he text of l'lautus has suf-
fered not a. little by the arbitrary changes that were made
for such pul-poses. His plays continued to lna-put 011 the
stage for a long time after the poet's death, and thore can
be no doubt that they are preserved to us in the form which
they received to fit them for these later reproductions. Some
of the prologues now prefixed to the plays may have been
written for persor-inances given about the middle of the first
century ns) To about the· same time probably belong the
acrostic arguments, or metrica] summaries, prefixed to all tho
plays of Plautus except the Bacchides. For the non-acrostic-
argumenm, which belong to a later period, see p. xxiii. As
early as the second half. of the second century nc, scholar-s
began, in imitation and emulation of the Greek grammarians,
to turn their attention to the study of fabulae palliatae. The
texts of the comedians were brought together in suitable
form for reading, special care being taken to preserve, as
far as possible, different readings wherever such existed.
Notes, too, on the history of the different plays were col-
lected and arranged in a connected manner. Lastly, Roman
scholars wrote various treatises on the scenic and linguistic
peculiarities of the old comedians, and on other topics of
interest to the student of literature. Among these were
1.. Accius (the famous writer of tragedy), Porcius Licinus,
Volcacius Sedigitus, 1.. Aelius Stilo, Aurelius Opilius, Q. Cos-
conius, Serv. clodius, and, above all, M. Terentius Varro,
whose works, distinguished as they were for their learning
and practical wisdom, formed the chief source of informa-
tion for the historians of literature. The material for these
