de tes to be taken with dixi, though the position of the phrase is
unusual.

431. horunc uerborum causa ε causa very seldoni means on ac-
count os, except where this phrase virtually means sor che sake os.
It is used 111 such sentences as ‘⁸ I left the city on account of impor-
tant business,'’ but not in such as “I left the city on account of

disaster.'' The present passage presents one of the extremely rare
exceptions to this rule. caueto (⁶2) : see App. fuas: common
in early Latin for sis‚· see Introd. ξ 88 (α).

432. cogitato: see note on 11. fide : quat-antee. See App.

433. pignori : for securz'cy.

434. ne = lest. meo e : υιῖο-ὶ.

435. te hic ι the h prevents elision 3 see App., and Introd. ᾗ 74.

436. ducas, deseras: introduced, like ianm-es, by the ne (4:34).

437. neque des: nequa instead of neue, because it is equivalent
to et non instead of ec mg· it negatives merely the word des, ne . . .
deseras neque des meaning lest you . . . fors-ake and fail co yive.
reducem facias: restore ‚· literally, nucleo returned.

course of time the subjunctive came to be felt (as in passages like
the present) to be dependent upon the sac. Later, a desire to make
this dependence clearer led sometimes to the insertion of uc, e.g.
Cic. Aa. II. 4. 4. It is therefore incorrect to say that ut is “omitted ’'
in expressions like fac sz's‚· such expressions merely represent an
earlier stage, nearer to parataxis. Cf. notes on 121, 360, 383. caue
fidem fluxam geras: i.e. be sure to keep qood saith with mc. See B.
305. 2.

440. omnia: the emphatic position of this word is intended as a
sly hint to Philocrates that nothing less than manumission should be
the reward for the sels-sacrifice that Tyndarus is making.

441. hunc: i.e. Hegio's son, whom you are to bring back. The
use of hunc in referring to the son is justified by the fact that the son
is the main object of thought, at least from Hegio'sfflQlt of vieW‚
and Tyndarus is choosing his words with especial reference to the
presence of Hegio. Hunc is commonly taken as referring to Hegio
himself, but this makes it impossible to interpret inuentum inueni sat-
isfactorily. inuentum inueni ; the son has already been “found '⁷
(inuentum) in the sense that they have learned of his whereabouts
(see 335ss he is now to be “found'' (immiti) 111 the sense that a
