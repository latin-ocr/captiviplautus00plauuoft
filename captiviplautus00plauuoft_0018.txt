regarding the meaning of the term saturae) seem to have
been devoid of any connected plot, but they demanded a
certain amount of care and skill 011 the part of the per-
sor-mers, and accordingly a class of people began to devote
special attention to aeting as a profession. We must of
course look upon these saturae (of which the contents were
of a purely local character, and the structure even yet not
artistic) as entirely different from the Greek comedies, as
far as their contents and their structure were coneerned.
A nearer approach to dramatic form was made in the fabulae
Atellanae, so called because they are said to have originated
in the Campanian town of Atella. The fabulae Atellanae
were broad farces in which figured stock characters analo-

pantomimo. Rude as all these performances were, they
nevertheless awakened in the Roman public an interest in
dramatic representations. Under favorable circumstances
they might have developed into an artistic drama that would
have been truly Roman in thought and feeling.

closer contact with the Greek cities of southern Italy and
Sicily, and had their attention called to the creations of
Greek genius. They never recovered from the spell that
was thus cast about them. Instead of attempting to create
a literature of their own along independent lines, they now
devoted themselves chiefly to copying the masterpieees of
Greece. The first fruits of this new influenee were seen in
mere translations and adaptations from the ὢ. The
eomedies that were thus translated, or adapted, are called

Comedy at Rome “’ (Amer. Jour. Phil. Vol. XV.)‚ Hendrickson ex-
presses the view that satura in Livy (7. 2) is merely the designation
of an assumed Roman parallel to the old Greek comedy.
