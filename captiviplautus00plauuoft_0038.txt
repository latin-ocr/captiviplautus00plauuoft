xxxii INTRODUCTION.

all. The same is true of all the early editions prior to that
of Pylades (1506). It is only during the present century
that most of the laws governing these early metres have
been discovered. Even yet many difficulties remain, and it
is frequently impossible to determine definitely the char-
acter of individua] verses or the points at which verse-
division should be made. In the Captivi, for instance,
there are twenty verses (212, 232-234, 497-515, 836> which
the recent critical edition of Goetz and Schoell makes no
attempt to assign to definite metres. On account of the
difficulties of Plautine and Terentian inetres, it has, since
the time of Bentley, been customary for each editor to
mark the main, or primary, ictuses in each verse, in order
to indicate what seems to him individually, or to editors
generally, the proper scansion.

37. For the proper under-standing of the classification
and discussion of inetres about to be given, the following
definitions should be noted: —

(a) arsis, used in this book to indicate the unaccented part
of a foot.

(b) thesis, used in this book to indicate the accented part
of a foot. (See, however, note on p. xlv.)

(c) diaeresis, that sort of division (within a verse) which is
caused by the coincidence of the end of a word with
the end of a foot, eg. in the verse —

[lte dblmsim εᾶίῖιῙοτῖἐ uenit Ι Hesperias Ι {te οᾶΙΡέΖῑεῖε,

there is diaeresis after uenit and again after Hesperus.
(d) hiatus, the coming together of two vowelsffleach with
its own natural quantity), caused by the non-elision
of a final vowel before a word beginning with a
vowel or h (but see Introd. ξ 7 4).
(e) semi-hiatus, the occurrence of a final long] vowel, or a
diphthong, before a word beginning with a vowel or
