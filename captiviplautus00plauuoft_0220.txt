emlura.

1010. faxo: parenthetica] and without influence upon the con-
struction of the rest of the sentence. For the force of the future per-

The more remote demonstrative is here used to indicate a return to
Stalagmus as subject (the e's just used, had referred to the father os
Philocrates) ; after the attention has thus been recalled to him, he is

then referred to as hunc. But see App. reducimus : one might

1015. quid huius filium: what of thz's man's son Ρ At first
thought, it may seem strange that Tyndarus receives the announce-
ment that Hegio is his father with a question about Philopolemus, but
it must be remembered that Tyndarus has been looking forward to and
longing for the return of Philopolemus as the one thing that could res-
cue him from his suffering and restore him to freedom. Upon seeing
Philocrates again before him, it is natural that his first thought should be
whether Philopolemus had been brought back with him. As his atten-
tion is absorbed by this (to him) all-important question, the improba-
ble announcement Just made by Philocrates, that Hegio, the man who
is responsible for his suffering, is his father, makes but little im-
pression upon him. Even when Philocrates repeats his assertion‚
Tyndarus is still very indifferent about the matter ; indeed, at first he
ignores the allusion to Hegio, and merely says (1019) that he will ·
make trouble for the slave who stole him. quid hfiffis: the h
makes the preceding syllable long. Possibly, however, we should
read hams ,· see G.-L. 104. 2. eccum: see note on 169.

1018. tuos: used objectively.

1019. grandis: contrasted with parvom (1018). ad carnu-
ficem: differs from cavatus-sici, in calling attention merely to the idea

as well as the ‘⁶ to-'' idea.

1020. Imperfect in metrical structure. meritam mercedem:
(ι desert (literally, reward) deserved.
