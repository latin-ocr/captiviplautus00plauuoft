authority ought always to bo respected until it has bes-n clearly
proved to be impossible. Furthermore, the presence of duplam in
the Mss. would be ‹liffieult to account for, if we suppose that dupla
was originally written, as duplam is the (IIfficile‘m- Iae›‹·ei0,· it would
never have occurred to a scribe to write duplam aquinum, ‹lonhlaee
lamb, if he had found dupla in his Μὴ, since dupla and duplum were
used of price commonly enough to have occasioned no difficulty.

(4) Finally, the parasite is complaining about the quality of
things, not about the price ; note, for instance, suvanos (813), pvervm·
(820). The price of food never worries a parasite.

The interpretation offered in my notes avoids all of these difficulties.
Aynos is the object of lucane, just as staluam is, in locant scaluavnsa-
ciendam ,· the only difference is that the lambs are contracted for as fit
lo be slauylcterecl,· the statue as one lo be made. In neither case does
locant imply that anything already in one's possession is to be handecl
over to some one else; it implica in either case, merely a contract for
something not yet in one’s possession. The locator, as Ilallidie says,
may be either the party who pays, or the party who is pald, according
to the nature of the contr-act. In the present passage the lanii are the
parties to be pald (by the public, with the understanding that the lamb
is to be young and tender). For another instance of caedundus in the
sense of fit to be killed, fat, see Aul. 567.

830. Bothe's conjecture of hie esc ,9 ecquis after ecquis is commonly
adopted, but it seems to me too uncertain to justify incorporating it
into the text.

1885, p. 202) holds that in tempore is not l’lautine Latin.

840. The Mss. end this line with noli irascier, which both desti-cys
the metre and is inappropriate. Probably these words have crept in
from 845, displacing what originally stood here.

this, see Fay‚ Ain. Jour. Phil. XVIII. p. 179.
