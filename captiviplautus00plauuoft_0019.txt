fabulae palliatae, from the Greek cloak (pallium) worn by
the actors, to distinguish thern from the fabulae togatae in
which Roman manners were represented. The first writer
to be mentioned in this connection is Livius Andronicus, who
was born at Tarentum about 284 r..‹·. After the capture of
his native city in 272 110, 110 became the slave of M. Livius
Salinator, who, charmed by the talents of the young man,
soon afterwards gave him his freedom. In 240 Livius was
engaged to produce, as one of the attractions of the lculi
Romani, two Latin plays, a tragedy and a comedy, adapted
from Greek originals. Such dramatic entertainments had
for a long time been regularly given in the original Greek
in the towns of southern Italy, and so were more or less
familiar to the Romans. These performances found such
favor at Rome that from this time 011 they became a regular
part of the games. Livius Andronicus must then be looked
upon as having introduced a new era for the Roman stage.
In Livy the historian (7. 2), the existence of a connected
plot and the systematic arrangement of the contents are
designated as the features that distinguished the new drama
from the old satura. It was further distinguished by the
employment of Greek metres and by differences in the form
of representation. Only a few fragments of the plays of
Livius have come down to us. lVe know, however, that he
was held in so great estecm at Rome that, in honor of him,
the temple of Minerva on the Aventine was appropriated to
the use of scribae et histriones, who organized themselves
into a sort of poets' guild.

6. Another writer, likewise active in both tragedy and
comedy, was Cn. Naevius, a native of Campania, born about
265 Β.0. Being a Latin by deseent, he took part in the
First Punic War, a conflict which he afterward described
in Saturnian verse. After 235 nc. we find him noted at
Rome as a. fiery and popular poet, especially in the field of
comedy. Fragments of thirty of his comedies have come
