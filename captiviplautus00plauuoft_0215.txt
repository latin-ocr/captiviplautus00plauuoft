Α ACT V. SCENE 1.

with the causa] quom, from which it is distinct in origin and develop-
ment5 the latter, in classical times, regularly took tlic subjiinctivc,
while the former was at all periods of the language constructi only
with the indicative. See note on 151. reducem : redum is probably
not from re(d)‹lucere‚ but froin redeo ,· ef. trem* from cet-reo. See App.

926. hunc: Stalagmus.

92⁷. haec . . . fides: i.e. the fides of Philocrates. Cf. eam
potestatem (934) for eius rei potestatem. See App.

928. ex animo et cura: from deep-semea αηπςὶρεῃς literally,

With ea: animo cf. the English expression, “from the bottoxn of my
beart.'' lacrumis: earlier form of lacrimis. ’

Stalagmus; cf. hunc in 926. pater mi: father mine‚· this use of
mi is chiefly confined to tender and affectionate expressions.

937. qua negem : a predicating characterizing clause of the origi-
