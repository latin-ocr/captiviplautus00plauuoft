variety of subject matter and connnonly explain the plot oi tln· play.

1. hos: this leads one to expect a voi-b to follow. os whivh η j„- ῃ,
be the object or the subject-:wcusative. bnt the anacolutlwn in tln· next
verse leaves this pronoun without gm‘erninvnt. 'l‘he accusative might
however be explained by supposing it to be attracted to agree with
qnos. .

2. mi qui astant, —hi stant ambo, etc: similar hnnwr might lw
brought out in English : ”Those bystanders there—they are standing,
both of them —the ‘ standers ¹ aren't soatcdst’ This good-nauum at-
tempt to cheat the spectators out of the interesting inforniation tln·
prologue had led them to believe was coming would in its-clf tend to
put them in good humor. One might, have expected i, instead of Ιιὶ.
See App. If the text is correct, there is hiatus after ιμιὶ.

3. testes estis: equivalent to testamini ,· hence the infinitivt¹ loqui.

4. hic: with a gesture toward Ilegio's house. hujus: with a
gestui-e toward Tyndarus.

5. su‘B sibi: the sibi intensities the idea of suo, but at the sanie
time lays stress upon the interests involved in the possession and in
the general situati0n3 ipsius might have taken the place of sun sihi,
but that would have concerned itself only with tho idea ot* possession.

6. operam datis: starts with the idea, putsortlz an effort ‚· accord-
ing to the application of this idea to various situations, it niay be trans-

8. alterum: to be pronouneed (clerium ef. such phenoinena in
English as “ev’ry‚’' “quiv'ring,'’ etc.‚ for “evcry‚'' “qtlivm-ing,’'
etc.: cf. also note on 306. The ‘⁶ iambic law '' does not apply to such
cases (see Introd. ξ 84), and the scansion (ῖῖίῐῖνῖιηι quod is not permissi-
ble. seruos : nominative. The nominative and accusative singular
of the second declension end in the earliest tiines in -οε and -om. These
endings became -us and -um toward the close of the third centiny ne..
except in words in which they were preceded by u (either vowel or
consonant). See Introd. §86 (a) ; cf. note on uiuent, 81. surpuit:
by syncope, for sur-rapuit.

9. eum: to be pronounced έῖιηι. profugiens: the present par-
ticiple here refers to an act prior to that of the principal verb ; strictly,
it should refer to an act going on at the tiine οἱ the selling, but even
Latin, and especially colloquial Latin, is sometimes inaccurate in its
use of tenses. The lack of a perfect active participle is often respon-
sible for such a nse as this; accuracy is sacrifl«·e‹l in the interest of
brevity. uendidit: for the long final syllable, see lntrod. ς· 82 (1¹).
