⁷6. The final s of words ending in is and (ts did not neces-
sarily make a long syllable before a following consonant.
Before a vowel it was probably sometimes elided, just as
final m was (see notes on verses 466, 532, 691, and App.
thereon). As late as the boyhood of Cicero, final 3 was
often very faintly prononnced, eg. satus) uerborum in 125
(instead of satis uerborum), 111ας]ἷ(3) noscas in 290 (instead of
maqv's noscas).

77. Final ἑ in the following words might apparently be
treated as a silent letter:¹ ille, inde, quippe, unde, nempe,
and probably some others occasionally3 eg. esse, and im-
peratives like mitte, dc'ce,· cf.—

Ι11 the interrogative particle —ne this final ἕ was not merely
often silent, but it was often omitted even iu writing3 eg.
certon (for certone) in 643, uiden (for uidesne). The disap-
pearance of final e is further illustrated in Ῐιῖο for hice, horunc
for horumce, dic for dice, etc.

78. The dissyllabic vowel combinations ea, eha, ei, ehi,
eo, eu, ia, ie, ii, 1111, 10, 111, 01, 0111, 111, ua, ue, uo, ale often
slurred together into a single syllable by svsnzzesis, eg.
eadem, eam, mea, mez, ει, rei, eodem, meos, eum, φπαίιαφη,

die, diu, otio, proinde, fuisse, duellum, duas.²

¹ It has been customary to explain the metrical phenomena con-
nected with these words by supposing the first syllable to be treated
as short, e.g. ille, inde, etc. 3 but see Skutsch, Studien zur Ρίαηῑίη-
ischen Prosodie (Leipzig, 1892), pp. 30ff. Skutsch, however, was in
part anticipated in his theory by Wase, Weise, Bothe, and Ritschl.

2 In the case of ἴα, ie, ι’ί, io, iu and ui, ua, uo, the pronunciation
above referred to was facilitated by the fact that i and u before a
vowel had a tendency to take on a consonantal character.
