Pion 4] PROLOGVS. 67

2. Predicating an act actually performed, or a state actually
existing (a type developed from 1);ι is esc qui mentiatur, he is «ι
man who ςήεαεε. Sometimes such a clause is used os the futuru. ;
e.g. 613, yart-iet quoi neque pes neque caput compareat, hc will
Μαῖα off something), to which there will uppem· neither head κω·
tait.

3. Predicating obligation or propriety (a type probably also
developed from 1): nihil eqo uideo quod (laudetis, I see nothing]
that you should gouyht to) rnjOice over.

4. Volitive. The relative clause, besides characterizing the ante-
cedent, may at the same time express the purpose of the aet οἱ the
principal clause, as in the English sentence, “Men are trying to
make machines that shall2 fly’'; here the flying of the wachines
is the act which the men purpose to bring about, and at the same
time the flying is to characterize the machines — they are to be
flying machines. cf. Tac. Βῖαῐ, 28. 6, cuius . . . committeretur.

Another type of volitive characterizing clause is represented by
hie est locus ubi sedeas, which may have originated in some such
paratactic use as hic esc locus,· laic sedeas (here is α 1›I‹cce,· sic here,
is ‘you like), where sedeas would be a weak jussive subjunctive, ex-
pressing mere permission.

 

13. mendicarier: play che beyqar, i.e. by asking favors of you,
by making persona] entreaties, which the actor regards as beneath his
dignity. The passive infinitive in -ier‚ for the classical -z'‚ is very com-
mon in early Latin, especially at the end of a verse.

14. ego me tua: the juxtaposition of these pronouns heightens
the emphasis (see Introd. ξ 99) and the swaggering tone: ζ am ποι
ροίηρ ιο burst Qssels sor Q—-don'c sool yoursels. tua: to be
read ιιΐα or ιάᾶ ,· see Introd. ἓξ 78 and 84. ne erres: see translation
in the preceding note. Perhaps, however, this clause denotes negative
purpose. rupturus: for rumpo and dirumpo in this sense, cf. l’laut.
Cas. 809; Poen. 540; Mero. 1383 Ter. Hec. 4353 Cic. ad sain. VII. 1.
4; Hor. Ep. Ι. 19. 5.

15. qui potestis ope nostra censerier: who can claim a place
among] men os means; literally, who can be raced by your wealth.

 

¹ This is the type of clause commonly designated as the “ Clause oi
characteristie.”

² “ shall ’' is used here to indicate t‘he determination of the men ; ‘⁴ wiu ”
would *indicate mere suturity without connoting any other idea.
