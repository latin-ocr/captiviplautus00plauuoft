83. Occasionally a syllable which in later poets is regu-
larly long is short in Plautus; eg. frustra, νρῖιτίιμιαηι
(n(e) utiquam), Ιιῖσ, illic, istic (the last three, as nomi-
native singular masculine, having the -z‘c always short> in

illc,· see note on 751, and Skutseh's Studien zar Ρίααείη.
Ρνοεοάίε, pp. 113 ff.

2. INFLUENCE OF VERSE-ACCENT AND Wonn-ACCENT.

84. The most important and. far-reaching peculiarity of
prosody 120 be noted in the dramatio poets is the frequent
shortening of a longvsyllable when it is immediately preceded
by a short syllable and immediately preceded, or followed, by
the verse-ictus,¹ or the word—accent. The influence of this
“iambic law '⁷ (so called because it concerns the combina-
tion υ -) may, then, change —

(l) υ-ᾼ to ura-L, eg. Ρῖιέν cervisa to ρϊιόν σα-ἷιεα,· &t <id
finum-es to ἐι ἄιῐ portitores,-

(2) u - ό ‘oo ψ v ό, e.g. bb Ιιᾶηο {morticinas to ob Ιιᾰιισ {ni-
micinas ,-

(3) (J- to (J υ , e.g. ὅρῳ) ἒνςχό to ὅσῳ) eryt).
