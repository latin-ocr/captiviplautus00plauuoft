of Aristophanes often unintelligible to one who is not famil-
iar with the condition of affairs in Athens at the tiine the
play was written3 it has the e‹.›s1n‹›politan character which
becomes, during the fourth and third centur-ies before Christ,
more and more noticeable in Greek life. It was owing to
this peculiar cosmopolitan character that the new comedy,
about the middle of the third century before Christ, found
a welconie in Rome—a city highly dev‹·loped politically,
but as yet without a literature. That the comio poets of
Rome chose the material for their translations and adapta-
tions exclusively from the new (and the so-called middle)
comedy is not, then, due wholly to the fact that that kind of
writing was still flourishing when Roman literature began.

4. ROMAN COMEDY.

4. The ancient Romans, like the Italians of to-day, had,
as one of their notable characteristics, a fondness for the

’ dramatic‚ and especially for the comic. Vergil, in Georq.

II. 385-396 (cf. Hor. Ep. H. 1. 139 ff), pictures the gayeties
of rural festivals, at which iinprovised jests, in rude verse,
were exchanged in animated dialogue. These versus Pes-
cennius, as they are commonly called (probably after the town
of Fescennia), had no literary importance3 but still we sec
in them germs similar to those from which thc Greeks dc-
veloped their artistic comedy. It is interesting also to note
that a process of development seems to have set in on
Roman, much as it did on Greek, soil. As a demand was
felt for something less rude than these versus Fas-(vnaius, a
form of representation arose for which preparation was
made beforehand, and less was intrusted to improvisatism.
To add to the interest of the entertaimant, the verses were
now accompanied by music and darming, and the whole
performance in this improved form took the name of Satura.
These performances‚ if we may accept the common view
