(2) just, precisely, a meaning ‹leveloped from a 1·‹‘·strictive appli-
cation Of the one just indicated (tn (Ιιιιί point, (tud uo surlles‘r,

(3) to that (end), with α view cn elme,-

(4) in addition to that, i.e. J‘utwher1nore, morem-er, besides. ln
this last sense, the thing added is sometimes (especially iu the
phrase atque adeo) opposed to the preceding context, when it may
be translated still.

quoi concredat: a predicating characterizing clause of the original
type3 see note on 12. hodie: this particle seems to be often used
in early Latin as a mere formality, without, temporal force. Perhaps
the nearest English parallel is the colloquial use of “now '' in such
expressions as ‘⁴ he did not say so at all, now‚’' “you'll never get oft
· like that, now.'' Sometimes this colorless hodie seems untranslata-
ble; in this passage it is commonly translated ever, though it probably

an indirect question of obligation‚ or propriety. See note on 208.
uiginti minas: about 3360. Such estimates‚ however, in ternis of
modern money are based merely on equivalence in weight of eoin,
without any reference to the relative purchasing power of the amount
in question.

354. optuma—immo: not αι all—the best os reasons rather
(why I should), optuma agreeing with causa understood, with which
cur dem is easily supplied. This position of {mmo is very unusual
before Livy ; in answering a question it commonly stands first.
