Pion 10] ACT 1. Sel-:NE 2. 83

negress frequently refers to herself as “dis po‘ chile.'' dolet:
is the trouble with.

153. quia: explicative, the fact that, the clause being in apposi-
tion with illud ‚¹ this use of qnia is common in Plautus, though in
classical times it gave place to quod and cum (see latter part of note
on quom in 151); cf. 203, nos pudet quia . . . ; Epitl. 107, idne pudet
te quia . . .; Cas. 378, inz'quomst quia . . .; Mil. 1210, istnc ‹lver-
bumst quia . . .; etc.‚ etc. In their origin, quod and quia alike
probably represent some accusative construction, quod being the
accusative neuter singular of a relative o-stem‚ and quia the aecn-
sative neuter plural of a relative i-stem ; cf. the ablativo qui and the
dative and ablative quibus from the same stem, by the side of the
ablative quo and the dative and ablative quis from the o-stem. re-
missus est edendi exercitus: the assembly of the Roman pcople
known as the comicia centuriata, though it early acquired political
power, was originally a military organizati0n3 the expression for
assembling this organization was exercitum imperare, and that for
dismissing it was ezercicum remittere. 'she expression is licre trans-
ferred to companies of banqueters. So long as Philopolemus was
present, there was some one to muster the troops, i.e. some one
to give (11111161- parties; in his absence, the banqueting army has
disbanded.

154. nullum : rarely used as a substantive in good classical prose,
except in the genitive and amative, where it regularly supplants
neminis and nemine.

155. dixu: for dixisti ,· cf. ‹lizem (clins-sem), dixe (dixisse), uite
(nai-sse), nixem (uz'oeissem), misti (misisti), sev-ipset (scripsisti),
sumpsti (sumpsisti), duxti (duxisti), <luz-e (duxisse), traxe (traxisse),
etc. Such shorter forms are very common in the early dramatists
and are not uncommon in later poets. There is a tendency among
recent authorities to regard them as having a different origin from the
full forms, but it may be that they are merely the result of syncope
(see Lindsay, The Latin Lanquaye, p. 464).

156. fugitant ε this frequentative form is almost entirely confinetl
to comedy; it here indicates eagerness and uncereinonious haste
(hm-ry away from), and its emphatic position adds to the humor.
They all know too well what it meant to give Ergasilus his dinncr.
prouinciam: office, duty.

1⁵7. quod obtigerat, etc.: whatever of ic (te. of th(— prouincia)
had fallen to their lot aster the capture os your Philopolemus. With
this use of quod, cf. such passages as Liv. 31. 4. 2, aqro Samniti
