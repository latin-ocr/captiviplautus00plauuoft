PREFACE. V

in devoting time and labor to reading the proof shoots and
for many valuable suggestions. Ι owe most, however, to
Professor C. Ε. Bennett, who has subjected every pago

searching criticiffln, aud suggested numerous improvements.
Many of the merits which I hope the present volume
may be found to have are iu no small degree duo to his
scholarly touch.
