nnto my misdeeds (any) escape. Maler'actz's and perfidiis (both in the
dative case). are, in a sense, personified ; cf. 523, confidentiae hospitium,
deuerticulum (lolis.

523. nec confidentiae . . . hospitiumst: i.e. there is no longer
anything for ine to depend up0n3 literally, nor is there any hos-
pitalt'ty (refugse) unco (sor) my c071fi1lence,· cf. Most. 350, nusquam

stabul umsc confidentiae. deuorticulum : place of resuye ‚· literally,

524. See App.

525. palam est: is out. neque de hac re negotiumst : nor is
there anythings to (lo about this matter.

526. quin male occidam: to save me from a miser-able sate,·
literally‚ bnt that I should bas-ely peris-h, quin follows the idea of

tem eri uicem meamque: from meetinq with disaster οη account
ofmy master ancl οη my own (acwnnt). In saying meamque (uicem),

Achilli, etc.

the Quirinal, and the summit on which it stood was called Collis
Salutaris. si uolt: i.e. etsi uolt. nec copiast: and there is
no chance (for me).

530. nisi si: is common where nisi alone would‘lrave sufficed.
corde: we should say, in my mind. machinor: the final syllable
here retains its original long quantity ; see Introd. § 82 (s). astu-
tiam: (some) elever scheme.

531. quam: i.e. quam astutiam. malum: consouml ic! malum
is an accusative of exclamation ; cf. “the mischief ! '³ quid
