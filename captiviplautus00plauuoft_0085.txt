SGENE 3.

Hegio, having heard from Philocrates (whom he supposes to be Tyn-
darus) the plausible story about the high standing and importance
at home of the latter's pretended master, now puts into execution the
proposed plan for securing the return of his captured son. He sends
the supposed Tyndarus back home to effect an exchange. The
parting, in the presence of Hegio, between the pretended slave and
the pretended master gives an opportunity for a elever bit of acting.
— The scene opens with a matter-of-fact dialogue in iambic senarii.
As the interest quickens, and as the time eomes to formulate the
message to be carried to the prisoner’s father (385, cf. 384) and to
say the parting words, the verse changes to trochaie septenaria} the
music again strikes up and continues to the end of the scene. See
Introd. 57 and 70.
