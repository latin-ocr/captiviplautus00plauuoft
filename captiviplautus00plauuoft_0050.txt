xliv INTRODUCTION.

79. A similar phenomenon, apparently, is found in the
monosyllabic use of the words eius, huius, quoius (effes,
laffizs, qa‘ofusss cf. 39, 106, 107, 289, 641.

80. The forms of aio are freely handled, and present
the following peculial-ities: ᾰῖι (592), ait (365), ᾶῖη (Am.
284), &bat (561), aiebatis (676), cais (613).

81. 111 certain words, a u that was, in later times, con-
sonantal appears as a vowel3 eg. reliquos is regularly
tetrasyllabic in Plautus and Terence (i.e. relicuos), larua
is regularly trisyllabis: (1.6. ῖανῐιᾶ); cf. solito, εἰίΐιᾰ, etc.,
in later poets.

82. The following vowels and syllables, commonly short
in classica] poetry, are sometimes long in Plautus : -—

(α) a in the nominative singular of masculine proper names
of the first declension3 e.g. Am. 439, Sosia.

(b) Final e of the infinitive3 e.g. Truc. 425, dar& Mil. 848,
promere.

(c) Final e in the ablative of the third declension, e.g.
914, carna· Ps. 616, «ηῑῖῖίτὲ.

(d) Final o in modo (the adverb), e.g. 458, As. 5, 869, 87 6,
etc. 3 and in ⁶²90·

(e) -at, -et, -it in the third person singular present of verbs
of the first, second, and fourth conjugations ¹ and -it
of the perfect (all originally long); eg. 11, oze-qd&
196, decen· 350, scin· 9, uenclz'clz‘t; 34, emin· Am. 643,
uz‘cz't‚· Mil. 214, astiti& Ps. 311. Similarly, in the
final syllable of subjunctive forms and of the imper-
fect indicative, the vowel was originally long.

(f) -ar, -or in the first person passive of verbsrffieg. Am.
559, loquum· Cccpt. 1023, reyredior ; and -or in the
nominative singular of nouus and adjectives (com-
parative degree), eg. soror, uzon· Zonqior, stultior.

1Fina1 -ἳι in the Sd conjugation is rare and probably due to
analogy; eric and similar futures occasionally occur.
