APPENDIX.

Tms Appendix is devoted chiefly to references, comments‚ or expla-
nations that seem called for by statements made in my notes, or by
readings adopted in my text. It has been taken for granted that users
of this book who are especially interested in the constitution of the
oext will have access to all the standard editions, with their manuscript

readings, critical notes, and appendixes.

Anconam-mr. 4. The various emendations of this lIne seem to me
so uncertain that Ι have adopted none of them in the text. l’ossibly
Plautus wrote captum after natum (Brugmann).

5. Editors commonly avoid the hiatus by writing in ibus for inibi.

Lnu: 2. 'Ibe most plausible emendation suggested for illi qui
astant seems to me to be that of Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 138),
viz, non uili quia scant, but the reading is so uncertain that the best
course seems to be to follow the Mss. See my note.

hi.- editors commonly read i, but the manuscripts uniformly read
Ιιί, which (with Bach and Leo) I have retained. For parallel instances
of ille and hic, both referring to the same person, see C'apt. 1014, illic
indicium fecit ,· nam hunc ez Alide huc reducimus; Mil. 22, periurio-
rem hoc hominem siquis uiderit, auc §lor-iarum pleniorem quam illic
esc‚· cf. Capt. llo-112, istos captiuos duos, heri quos emi de praeda de
quaestoribus, his indito catenas, etc. (according to the manuscripts);
ib. 733-734‚ abducite istum . . . iubete huic crassas compedes inpinqier.

10. patri huiusce: this line has hitherto been considered corrupt
and has been variously emended, but see my note, with references
there given.

optumumst: Lindsay ( The Journal of Pltiloloqy‚ 52, p. 287) thinks
that “absolute certainty is attached'’ to Leo's emendation, optume
est. The latter certainly represents the regular usage in this sense,
bnt under conditions similar to those in the text, we might in English
say either ‘⁴ very well ” or ‘⁶ very goo‹l,” and it seems at least possible

that optumum est was occasionally used in the sense of optume est.
