rma ω] Ac'r iv. sensi: 2. 147

denium instruam aarum. olim: formerly, sooner, i.c. before 1
had heard good news for you. istuc 2 referring especially to abi.

873. saluom et sospitem ι sose and souml ,· ec must be regarded
as connecting merely the two ternis of this couplet, the couplet itself
being added as a unit to ninom ,· ee is scldom used to add the last term
of a series, when the other terms are without connectives.

874. publica celoce: packec boat. illum adulescentulum:
i.e. Philocrates

875. una : with kim.

877. in malam rem: to the deuce. ita. . . amabit, . . . ut:
this is a common formula for soleinnly certifying to the truth of an
assertion, though the subjunctive ιἰα . . . amet, ut is more common.
In the present passage the future indicative and the subjunctive are
found side by side ; cf. condecoret in the next line. In the case of this
future indicative, the conception seems to be, is {joina to bless (love) me
accordinq as Ι have actually scen (ancl, therefore, speak the trum),
implying that is I am saying that I have seen, when in reality 1 have
not, then I have no hope of being blest; hence. you may be sure my

words are true. sancta Saturitas: Sc. Cramsu115 humorously
personified as the goddess whom the parasite serves.
878. itaque . . . cognomine: i.e. may I always be called Cram-

fun with as much truth to the reality; Plautus probably has in
mind here such names as Saturio (a parasite in the Persa has this
name). Goynomine seems here used as a general term. without
reference to its distinction, when strictly used, from praenomen and
nomen.

879. genium: qood anach* see note on 290. In calling Philopo-
lemus his qenins, Ergasilus is thinking of the sumptuous dinner he is
expecting to get in consequence of the former's return.

880. Alidensem : Elean ,· from Alis for Elis, corresponding to the
Doric Ἀ·λις for ῗΗλις. μὰ. τὸν Ἀπόλλω : μά in Attio Greek is used
chiefly in negative oaths, no, by -, but occasionally, as here, it is
used affirmatively‚ 3188, by —.

88].. gnatum: see note on 19. ναὶ τὰν Κόρανε (ves) by C'ora.
cora is another name for Proserpina, the queen of the lower regions3
but it‘was also the name of a town in Latium, a coincidence which
suggests to Ergasilus the idea of swearing by several other towns in
Latium (Praeneste, Signia. Frusino, and Alatrium), as though they,
too, were goddesses. Ergasilus' indifference to the real gender of
these town names and the consequemini airs he gives himself by swear-
ing in Greek, instead of Latin, add touchcs of humor to the scene.
