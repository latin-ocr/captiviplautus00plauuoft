implying vain regret for the ‘⁴ good old days.’' ebrius : the
saturitate (from satur, saterl with sumt), occupying thc first place in
the clause (see Introd. ς· 99), has already donc justice to the memories
of the good things he had to eat ; at an equally emphatic place iu the
sentence, ebrius lingers over inemories of the all-too-tempting drinks.
The dependence of saturitate upon ebrius is incongruens, and for that
reason humorous ; his condition at such times was the result of both
food and (ΙΙ-ὡκ, and he wished to give full credit to the merits of each.

which were used for the two together. This would allow the captives
greater freedom of movement, and the order would be in harmony with
that in the next line. This word seems extremely rare. in any sense.

the verb, iuncti expressing the state in which they are.
