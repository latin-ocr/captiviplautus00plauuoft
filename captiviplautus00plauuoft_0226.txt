162 APPENDIX.

113. For the punctuation after istas, instead of after εἰηρῑιῑανίαε,
see Bach‚ Scademancl's Stude'en, ΙΙ. (1896) p. 322.

120—121. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 289) argues that a line
must have dropped out between these lines.

121. Schrader conjectures men for mene and ipsus for ἐρωῇ,- see
Dissertationes Arqenloratenses, VII. p. 263. On the supposed use of
-ne in the sense of nonne, see Morris in Am. Jour. os Phil, XI. pp.
19 ff.

136-137. Regarded as interpolations by Karsten (Mnemosyne,
XXI. p. 298 ff).

139. For the justification of the statement made in my notes, to
the effect that there is no such thing in Latin as a negative question of
deliberation, see The Lalln Prohibita-e (Am. Jour. of Phil„ XV. pp.
313 ff.); also Cornell studies in Classical Philoloqy‚ VI. pp. 213 ff.

151. For quom (cum) in the sense of che fact thal, see, e.g., Hale,
The Cum·Constrnclz'ons, pp. 79 and 242.

152. For the use of the subjunctive in expressions of obligation or
propriety, see The Latin Proleibitive (Am. Jom. of Phil„ XV. p. 313),
and Cornell Scudies in Classical Philolossy, VI. p. 213. For a dif-
ferent view, see Bennett, Cornell Stuclz'es in Classical Philol09y‚ IX.
pp. 1-30.

152-167. Er. Eheu . . . bonum animum. These verses are re-
garded by Karsten as interpolations. For ἑΙιεΤι Itu-ic, see note on 148,
with references there given. ’

157. quod emmeram the editors who retain this line at all, fol-
low Camerarius in changing quod to quo& but see my note. The
reading of the Mss. seems as likely to be right as any one of the
numerous conjectures.

169. Intus is commonly added before Aleum, on metrica] grounds,
but unnecessarily. See my note and Birt (Rhezfn. Mas. for 1899,
p. 61).

172. For the force of the perfect tense in prayers, eta, see my
Scucle'es in Latin Moods ancl Tenses (Cornell Scudies in Classical
Philoloqy, VI.). For an opposing view, see Bennett‚GeQzell Studies
in Classical Plziloloyy, IX., and for an answer to this critique, see
American Journal of Philologus, XXI. (1900).

175. I follow Leo in retaining the reading of the Mss. te
uocari. The usual emendation (a te uocari) misses the wit of Ergasi-
lus' words, referred to in the next line, and is less in harmony with
num umatus es ? in 173. See note.

179-181. See Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 303).
