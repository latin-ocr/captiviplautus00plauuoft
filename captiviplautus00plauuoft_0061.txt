(c) Plupersect .· The pluperfect indicative is sometimes used
where the perfect would seem more natural to the
English idiom, Capt. 194, ml δ[ναῶ-νηὶ, quo ire ‹lia-eram,
νηοῖο fuero. The tense was, however, feltwby tii}
Romans as a true pluperfect referring to time prior
to a more or less clearly defined point in the past.
Similar uses are not wanting in English. One often
hears a person say, in reply to a suggestion just
made by some one to whom he is talking, ‘⁶ Ι hadn’t
thought of that,'' i.e. “had not a moment agO, before
you called my attention to it.’' It would on such
occasions always be equally appropriate to say, “I
did not think of that.'' The choice of tense depends
solely upon the point of view.

the ablative with opus est ancl usus est, eg. Cas. 502, uicino
conventost opus, there is need of meetinq the. ncz'yhb(›1·; liter-
