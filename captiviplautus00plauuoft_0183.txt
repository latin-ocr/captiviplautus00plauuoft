243. nimio: very 11111‹'le,· ῑιι its origin, m‘min is ablativo. of degree
of difference, but it came to bc felt as an adverb. mauelim : the

fuller form of malim ,· the subjunctive would be used herc even in an
independent clause; incident-'illy it may serve here to characterize
the antecedent. of quom (forming a predicating characterizing clause
of the original type; see note on 12), as in Enn. Αιιη. :3821 (Vahlen),

nunc esc ille (lz'es qnam (floria murima sese Nobis ascendat, si 711'111'- Α

mus siu-e morimur, though this latter is a clause of the ‹levelopcd
type. Cf„ however, 518, where the indicative is used in a similar
clause.

⁵1⁷. spernunt: here in its original sense of separate, a rare use.

518. hic illest dies, quom: see note on 516. See App.
meae: maie. sperabilist: i.e. sperabilis est,· fm- thc disappear-
anco of the final s and the initial e, see note on captust in Argu-
mentum, 1.

519. neque exitium exitio: the accusative exitium is governed
by the idea of exire (construed with the accusative in the sense of evade,
avoid), that is present in the verbal substantive exicio (nominative
case), an evadinq. A similar phenonienon is occasionally met with
in English, in expressions like ‘⁶ there's 110 evading death,” where the
use of “no'’ shows that ‘⁶ evading'' is felt as a substantive, while
the use ot* ‘⁴ deat ,'’ instead of “ of death,'' shows that ⁶* evading’' is
felt as partaking also of a verbal nature ; see Introd. ξ 92 (a). The
pun in exitium exicio is inimitable. neque adeo : nor yet‚· see note
on 348. quas . . . aspellat: to ‹lrive away, or perhaps which shall
clv-ive away. Such clauses are commonly explained as akin to purpose
clauses ; but perhaps they are developed from an anticipatory use of
the subjunctive, —-a use common in Homeric Greek, but not preserved
in Latin except in certain subordinate clauses (eg. in subjunctive
clauses introduced by antequam, priusquam, donec, ete). See App.

521. See App.

521ff. sycophantiis, perfidiis: acts of cunninq, acts of treachery.
Plautus is fond of plurals of abstract nouus ; cf. Trin. 490, opulentiam

522. neque deprecatio perfidiis, etc.: i.e. the conscquencos
