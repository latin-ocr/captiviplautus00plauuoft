Pium 48] ACT IV. SCENE 2. 143

two leaves of the door. Ergasilus needed plenty of room in his pres-
ent inflated condition.

833. perlubet: I should like very murlo. hominem colloqui:
the construction of colloquor with the accusative is rare except in Plau-
tus. Other writers would say cum homine colloqui. Ergasilum: the
position of this word gives much the same emphasis asin ‘⁴ Ergasilus ! —
who calls Ergasilus ἵ) ” qui : the later distinction between quis and
qui does not seem to have been ohserved in early Latin. Even in
classica] times it was sometimes disregarded.

834. nee facit nec faciet ε plays upon the two meanings of
respicere‚· (1) look· back ac. in which sense Hegio has just used it;
and (2) have '‘essai-(ljbr, be propicious co.

835. mihi: lassare, you.

836. quantumst . . . optume : (where one might expect omnium
hominum quisunt optumorum optume) thou best os all che best men
who exist ‚· literally, as much as exists of men, chon best os the best (os
them) ; cf. Rncl. 706 ; Ps. 351 ; Ter. Plcorm. 853. Similar expressions
of quantity, where one might expect an expression of number, are
common in Catullus and elsewhere. in tempore: in the niele os
time. See App.

837. nescioquem: nescio quis came to be felt merely as forming
an indefinite pronoun. In this use all conseiousness of nescio as a verb
seems to have been lost; even in Cieeronian Latin the expression is
followed by the indicative, rather than by the subJ’unctive of indii-eet
question. In this use the o of nescio is short; as an independent
word, nescio forms a eretic (nescio), though exceptions to this rule may
be found. ubi cenes: (some one ον other) to dine wich,· literally,
with whom you may cline, a volitive characterizing elause; see note
on 12. Ubi is frequently used in the sense of apud quem, just as unde
is used for a quo. eo fastidis: that is why you are putcz‘ny οη airs.

838. cedo: an imperative form, (sive here, here with, out wilh, or
the like ; plural eecce (for cedite Ρ).

839. quid . . . gaudeam? a question of obligation or propriety ;
see note on 353. gaude modo ε modo is frequently thus added to
an imperative for emphasis, where we use “just”

840. This line is apparently incomplete. See App.

841. iam: see note on 251. omnis maculas: corresponding to
the English ⁴⁸ every speck.''

842. quod gaudeam: on account of which I should rejoice, a char-
acterizing clause of obligation or propriety3 see note on 12. As the
ablative ease originally ended in cl, quod, in cases like this, may be a.
