tragedy had their origin. Tragedy‚ however, was earlier
than comedy in reaching maturity.

2. THE EARLY GREEK COMEDY.

2. The word “eomedy'' (κωμῳδία) means literally the “song
of revclry '³ (κῶμος, ᾄδειν), 01· possibly the song of the κώμη,

first dramatized the rude dialogue in which com'edy had its
origin, and of having given it something like a litei-ary form.
The principal representative, however, of that branch of lit-

the period of Pericles, was Epicharmus, a contemporary of
Aeschylus. But comedy did not reaeh any high degree
of development until it was taken up by the master artists
of Athens in the time of Pericles. The eonditions of Greek
life at this period wei-e peculiarly favorable for developing
this branch of writing. The intellectnal activity and the
highly developed politica] life of the times worked together
to bring it rapidly to a position of great im portance and influ-

mentioned as writers of the old Attio comedy3 but these are
of little importance in comparison with Aristophanes, who
appeared upon the scene in the latter part of the fifth cen-
tury Iao. (444-388) and became by far the most important
representative of the old school. It lies, of course, in the
nature of conicdy to depict the gay and humorous3 and
at the time with which we are now dealingfthe keen
and absorbing interest taken by all classes in polities gave
direction to the popular comedy. Public men and affairs
formed its material. These were subjected to that keen wit
with which the Athenians, above all others, were endowed.
With ressa-enee to form and iochnique, it was natural enough
