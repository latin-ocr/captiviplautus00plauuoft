99. Generally speaking, the most emphatic points in a
Latin sentence or verse are the beginning (except for the
subject of an independent sentence) and the end (except for
the verb). Emphatic ideas tend to find utterance first,
but special effects are often produced by saving an emphatic
word or phrase till the end of the clause, for the mind to
dwell upon. An unusual arrangement of words (eg. re-

makes them emphatic. A shifting of words in the middle
of a sentence is less noticeable, and so produces less
emphasis. ‚Freedom of position is limited, for purposes
of emphasis, only by the necessity of avoiding obscurity
or an overburdening of the mind. For the normal order
of words in a Latin sentence, see A. & G. 3435 B. 348-
3503 G.-L. 6743 H. 560 f. In a short sentence, e.g. Oaesar
