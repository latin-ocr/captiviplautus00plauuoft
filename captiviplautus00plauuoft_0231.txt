APPENDIX. 167

518. Regarded by Karsten as an interpolation.

519. On the anticipatory subjunctivo, see Halc's 7710 Antiri'palory
Subjtmccive in Greek ancl Latin (Unr'v. os Chic-(190 Stadios ιή Classe·-
σαι Phae‘loloqy, 1.).

521. Regarded by Kamten as an interpolation.

524. operta . . . aperta sunl: Karsten regards these words as an
interpolation.

52⁷. uenit modo l intro: with our imperfect knowledge of tlie
restrictions of hiatus, it 15 35 well to allow it at this unusual place
in the verse as to alter the reading of the Mss. Additional doubt,
however, is caused by the anapaest in the seventh foot.

532. ineptias incipisse: Leo (Plautia. For-sch. pp. 224 ff.) shows
that final s is much more frequently disregarded in Plautine verse
than has been supposed. After a short vowel, it may not only
be disregarded before an initial consonant of a following word, but
it is often elided also before an initial vowel (see App. 466), as m
continued to be in classical times. In lines like the present one (Leo
cites numerous others, p. 297 f.), it may be that s was similarly elided,
though preceded by a long vowel (just as m was elided, without
regard to the length of the preceding vowel). Leo, however, excludes
such an hypothesis as inadmissible. Possibly we should read imfpltffis
{ulcipissa

536. I have followed Leo in letting mihi begin this verse. In the
Mss. it ends the preceding line, where it cannot possibly stand.

541. See App. 152. There can be no doubt- that the subjunctive is
frequently used in Latin to express the idea of obligation or propriety,
where the only correct translation is made by the use of should, ought
to, or some equivalent expression5 see Cornell Scudies in Classical
Pltiloloqy, VI. Part ΙΙΙ.

54⁷. It is not necessary to make any emendation here. See note.
To change hic to istic destroys the alliteration, which seems intentional.

550. epulatur: it seems to me that editors have changed this to
insputarier without sufficient reason. We know next to nothing about
the usage of either of these words, and in the face of such ignorance
it is wiser to let the reading of the Mss. stand. The fact that
sputo occurs once in Plautus and once in Ovid in an active form is
hardly sufficient evidence for rejecting sputalur here as a collateral
deponent form. Verbs which are found in both active and deponent
forms, even in the same author, are common ; see, for instance, diction-
aries under proficiscor, proficz‘sro,· amplexor, amplmro ,· sortior, sorcio ,⁰
comitor, comico,· and many others (see Introd. §89). Thc interpre-
